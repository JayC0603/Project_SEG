9,DA,2 ‚≠ê,Mar 19 2025,"You don't know how good a travel insurance company is until you have a claim.And after this claim experience I would look at another travel insurance company next time.We had a claim because Royal Caribbean cancelled the stop at their Private Island.  Instead they parked the Icon of the Seas off the coast of West Palm Beach for 2 days.  There is no way access their Island without taking another cruise for $800 each.The cruise line gave everyone an official letter to submit to their travel insurance company to submit a claim.We submitted the claim online and it sat for 14 days no action and email from Allianz.  When we checked the status online--it said they needed more documentation to process the claim--but they never never notified us of such.  We uploaded the bill from the cruise line which they wanted again--same document submitted the first time still in their folder.  Had we not checked the status, the claim would still be pending because they do not let you know if they need more information--you are required to check the claim regularly and follow up with them.When you upload a new document it says it resets the time to 14 day for Allianz to review the claim.Now 30 days after we submitted the claim they paid us just $200 and mailed a check.It's really too low a payment because it would take $1600 for both of us to take a 3-day cruise just to see the private island.  The Icon of the Seas 7-day cruise costs $5000.00 for both of us not including air.I don't have confidence in Allianz that they would properly pay another more costly claim next time so I would look at another travel insurance company.",dont know good travel insurance company claimand claim experience would look another travel insurance company next timewe claim royal caribbean cancelled stop private island instead parked icon seas coast west palm beach days way access island without taking another cruise eachthe cruise line gave everyone official letter submit travel insurance company submit claimwe submitted claim online sat days action email allianz checked status onlineit said needed documentation process claimbut never never notified us uploaded bill cruise line wanted againsame document submitted first time still folder checked status claim would still pending let know need informationyou required check claim regularly follow themwhen upload new document says resets time day allianz review claimnow days submitted claim paid us mailed checkits really low payment would take us take day cruise see private island icon seas day cruise costs us including airi dont confidence allianz would properly pay another costly claim next time would look another travel insurance company

Went on the trip and all was good until the end when a snow storm cancelled our return flight home. The airline we flew with was unable to get us back home for two days. I called Allianz and the representative I spoke with was very nice and assured me that I had enough coverage to pay for the hotel and food for both days telling me that I had $150 per person per day and there are 5 of us so good to go. Two nights in the hotel plus food in Fort Lauderdale totaled the max (that I thought) of $1500. Turned in claim with receipts. Claim paid $750. Called in and the rep I talked to this day said that yes, it says $150 per person per day but that is also the maximum. I said that is very deceiving policy language and even my husband who is a State Farm agent for 20+ years did not read it like that and their own representative who I spoke with prior to proceeding didn't read it that way and she basically told me there was nothing she could do so now I am stuck with the other $750 I was not expecting to pay.

It took about a month and half a dozen calls after I submitted all the documentation on line, following all the instructions,  just to get my claim wrongly denied. Your phone service is dismal. After navigating an endless menu, calls are answered by a call center where employees only read from a script, without understanding of my issue. Repeatedly, I got emails demanding the documentation I had already sent. When I finally was able to talk to people in the claims department (three calls at different dates after not getting the messages/calls I had been promised), I had to go through the whole description of my claim as if for the first time. Although some of these individuals agreed I had a case, I finally got a notification my claim was denied. I am still trying to get some help from the cruise company I traveled with in order to solve this issue.

The denial was delivered with a level of professionalism that, while polished, did little to address the legitimacy of my concerns or provide meaningful assistance.Ultimately, I found the entire process to be a waste of both time and money.

I submitted a claim to Allianz because I lost out on a deposit I put down on a boat rental, as well as for a water taxis shuttle and a day of guided fishing which altogether totaled about $1,000. Allianz rapidly paid only part of my claim (only $250) because they said my knee injury was a ""pre-existing"" condition. I was very disappointed in this and felt I was ripped up. My injury occurred 3 and 1/2 months AFTER I purchased travel insurance, so how in the world is this a pre-existing condition! I ended up losing $750 on this trip.

The claim was finalized on January 14, 2025, with a payout of $1,600, which is incorrect based on my policy coverage and submitted documentation.Upon reviewing the details, it is clear that Allianz miscalculated the reimbursement amount by basing the payout on the wrong trip cost. The original cost of my trip was $2,899, and I received a $400 discount, making my final out-of-pocket cost $2,499. However, Allianz incorrectly applied the 80‚Äì85% refund policy to a $2,000 trip cost, leading to an underpayment of approximately $400.I brought this error to your attention immediately, but instead of reviewing my documentation properly, I was dismissed and told that the underwriter‚Äôs decision was final. I then obtained additional documentation from the travel agency that clearly outlines the correct trip cost and resubmitted the required paperwork on January 15, 2025. Despite this, I have yet to receive the corrected payment, and I find this delay unacceptable.Requested Action:1. Immediate correction of my claim payout to reflect the correct reimbursement amount based on my out-of-pocket cost of $2,499.2.

6263,AE,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 03 2025,"I am writing to express my extreme frustration with Allianz Partners USA, as my experience with them has been nothing short of a nightmare. I was involved in an accident and filed a claim in good faith, expecting that the company would follow through on its promises and provide me with the support and reimbursement I needed. However, it has now been months since I filed the claim, and I am still dealing with a lack of resolution.The worst part of this entire process has been the incredibly slow and unhelpful response times. I‚Äôve had to follow up multiple times, and every time, I am either given vague responses or simply ignored. It has been impossible to get any clear answers about my claim status, and despite providing all the required documentation, they continue to drag their feet.Not only have I had to wait for months without any real progress, but now Allianz Partners USA is outright refusing to resolve my issue. They have made no effort to address my concerns or provide any kind of acceptable solution. I have reached out for help with covering the expenses I‚Äôve incurred, and each time, I am met with unhelpful responses and empty promises.This is not just a case of bad service; it feels like I‚Äôve been deliberately ignored and mistreated by a company that should be offering support in times of need. Instead of taking responsibility for the situation, Allianz is passing the buck and making no effort to rectify the issue. The stress and frustration of dealing with them have only worsened my situation, as I have now been left with significant financial burdens that should have been covered.It feels like they are playing games with me, refusing to take accountability for their lack of service and refusal to honor their commitments. The lack of professionalism and basic customer service is absolutely appalling. I trusted Allianz to be a reliable partner, but instead, I feel completely let down and ignored.If you are considering Allianz Partners USA for any type of insurance or assistance, I strongly advise you to think twice. They have shown me nothing but disrespect and incompetence, and I am still left without the support I need. I will never use their services again, and I will be sharing this experience with as many people as possible to warn them of the unacceptable treatment I‚Äôve received.Allianz Partners USA‚Äôs complete failure to resolve my claim, the months of waiting with no progress, and their refusal to take responsibility has been disastrous.

What made it great was buying Allianz insurance in the first place and having it work for me when needed and they came through!After getting no where with American Airlines Claim Dept. from Oct. 2024 - January 2025, I called Allianz. I had to wait almost 3 weeks for a response, but it was a positive one! I was given a full monetary refund for two non-transferable AA airline tickets purchased to a location family wedding to be held at The Biltmore in Ashville, NC on Oct. 5, 2024. We all know what happened in that area because of Hurricane Helene.The Allianz customer service reps were patient and empathetic to my plight and explained everything I needed to submit for a claim, and it worked! I truly am very grateful and will continue to use Allianz in future travels. So thank you, Allianz!Sadly, American Airlines let us down terribly. We have been loyal customers for 21 years and we were at the beginning of the AA Mileage rewards program. We purchased 2 tickets to Ashville, NC on March 27, 2024 for an October 5, 2024 wedding. The cost was over $1,000. The Biltmore cancelled the wedding September 30th and the guests were then informed, and we cancelled our trip. The bride later rescheduled for April 6, 2025. The devastation and loss of lives in Ashville, NC from Hurricane Helene was horrific. American Airlines cancelled our flight on Oct. 4th. They would NOT extend our Flight Credit of even 9 DAYS before the 1 yr. purchase deadline of March 27, 2025, AND they would not refund our money with a Travel Credit! They did not care enough, and we are heartbroken by that.We had also purchased 6 tickets with American Airlines, with cash and points in March of 2024 for our 10-day family trip to CA and HI trip to be used in December 10-18, 2024. Obviously we were doing a lot of business with American Airlines. Why they didn't make the effort to accommodate us with a cash refund is beyond us.

7967,LF,2 ‚≠ê,Jan 24 2025,"Our ordeal was as follows.Linda (Cherene) fell on the very first day of the cruise (Saturday, December 7), within about an hour of departure.She was in the ship's hospital for almost two days and we incurred medical bills.We were then transferred (Monday, December 9) to a Mexican hospital (Blue Net) where we incurred more medical bills.We had been informed by the ship's doctors who were in email communication with Alliance (you should be able to access these emails) that she was not going to be admitted to the Mexican hospital, but we were to be met at the Mexican hospital by an air ambulance service and transported back to the US to UC Irvine. All of it covered by Alliance.I spoke on the phone to a Dwayne at Alliance on Sunday night (December 8) who said he could see the emails and then confirmed the arrangements. You should also have some documentation of this conversation. The only open item was which hospital she was to go to. The Ship's doctors and Captain preferred Blue Net where they had a prior relationship with, and Alliance wanted her taken to a different hospital. Emails from the ship had requested this. Dwayne said he could see this email request as well. I too requested Dwayne to have her taken to Blue Net. Dwayne told me that this was possible and that a Case Manager would call me back immediately. A Case Manager never called back. The Ship's doctors told me later that night that Alliance had approved her going to Blue Med for transportation back to the US.These arrangement had all been confirmed.When we arrived at Blue Net, Linda was there, not admitted. I inquired about the air ambulance and I was told by the Blue Net administration that the air ambulance was confirmed and that they were waiting for the air ambulance staff to arrive. We did not know at what time. We waited, in the belief that the air ambulance staff would arrive almost immediately as arranged. It was critical that Linda be taken to UC Irvine in California as soon as possible for surgery.As time lapsed, I called Alliance. I was then told to my shock and dismay that no air ambulance would be coming. While I was trying to figure this out and speak to Alliance, there was NO cooperation from Alliance.This threw us into a tail spin and panic. At that time, my only concern was to get get Linda back to the U.S. urgently. I would settle the Alliance matter later.We were in constant communication with my children in California (my two sons are doctors) and my daughter who were very concerned and were trying every option to get her back.We tried to make private arrangements for a Mexican based air ambulance service through the hospital. My daughter was looking for the service in the U.S. Time lapsed. We then began making arrangements with the Mexican company at a cost of $35,000.After two days of stress, panic and aggravation with no cooperation from Alliance, we found that the Mexican service was not able to get her into a U.S. hospital, and on time. More time had now lapsed.We then made a collective decision to fly her home on the first available commercial flight, with a lot of pain and discomfort to Linda and stress and anxiety for both of us, which we did. She was taken to UC Irvine for surgery.It is my understanding that Alliance should have facilitated her transfer by air ambulance back home and to the U.S. I have read the entire policy provided to us and it is still my understanding. All arrangements were agreed upon by all parties.Why was this not done?What is Alliance going to do about this? This matter is not closed.Dayantha Manilal Fernando(Linda's husband who accompanied her on the cruise and was with her throughout the ordeal)UPDATE:While at the Mexican hospital - BlueNet - we were told that the hospital was in communication directly with Alliance and that Alliance had agreed to be billed directly. Bills were to be sent to Alliance. We were requested to pay a deposit of $6,300.Alliance now wants us to submit the bills to them and has not reimbursed us our money.Terrible service and experience.AAA, our travel agent was also involved in all of this.",ordeal followslinda cherene fell first day cruise saturday december within hour departureshe ships hospital almost two days incurred medical billswe transferred monday december mexican hospital blue net incurred medical billswe informed ships doctors email communication alliance able access emails going admitted mexican hospital met mexican hospital air ambulance service transported back us uc irvine covered alliancei spoke phone dwayne alliance sunday night december said could see emails confirmed arrangements also documentation conversation open item hospital go ships doctors captain preferred blue net prior relationship alliance wanted taken different hospital emails ship requested dwayne said could see email request well requested dwayne taken blue net dwayne told possible case manager would call back immediately case manager never called back ships doctors told later night alliance approved going blue med transportation back usthese arrangement confirmedwhen arrived blue net linda admitted inquired air ambulance told blue net administration air ambulance confirmed waiting air ambulance staff arrive know time waited belief air ambulance staff would arrive almost immediately arranged critical linda taken uc irvine california soon possible surgeryas time lapsed called alliance told shock dismay air ambulance would coming trying figure speak alliance cooperation alliancethis threw us tail spin panic time concern get get linda back us urgently would settle alliance matter laterwe constant communication children california two sons doctors daughter concerned trying every option get backwe tried make private arrangements mexican based air ambulance service hospital daughter looking service us time lapsed began making arrangements mexican company cost two days stress panic aggravation cooperation alliance found mexican service able get us hospital time time lapsedwe made collective decision fly home first available commercial flight lot pain discomfort linda stress anxiety us taken uc irvine surgeryit understanding alliance facilitated transfer air ambulance back home us read entire policy provided us still understanding arrangements agreed upon partieswhy donewhat alliance going matter closeddayantha manilal fernandolindas husband accompanied cruise throughout ordealupdatewhile mexican hospital bluenet told hospital communication directly alliance alliance agreed billed directly bills sent alliance requested pay deposit alliance wants us submit bills reimbursed us moneyterrible service experienceaaa travel agent also involved

8079,SP,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 24 2025,"Everything!  My mother is in the hospital fighting for her life and your bogus insurance doesn't cover it! When I purchased the airline tickets in November of 2023 for my Cruise set to leave end of July 2024, i was given an option to insure my flight without different policies to select from. It was one policy that I couldn't even read. I did not plan on my mother needing a liver transplant in March of 2024. Because of this event, I needed to cancel my cruise plans as the transplant has had many complications. Instead of canceling, I rebooked a cruise for end of April 2025 and asked the airline to change my date to April 25, which they did. I thought by doing this my policy would carry on with the tickets until they were used. My mother will likely not make it and for circumstances beyond my control, I can not attempt this trip in good conscious when I may be mourning the loss of a loved one. I gave you all the evidence you needed from the ICU (doctor's letters with hospital insignia on letter head, email receipts from American Airlines, and they're playing the ""policy doesn't cover that time period"" card. So I am stuck with a $3,370.40 credit with American Airlines that expires in April 2026. When i spoke with Allianz representative she just kept regurgitating the same old line that the policy doesn't carry over. Instead of putting a decision maker on the line, or attempting to work with me, the answer was no. I was not told by the airline when I rebooked that the policy ended, or that I should purchase a new one. I probably would have at that time not knowing my mother's future. I've heard from people never to purchase these because of the fine print. I learned a valuable lesson to never purchase the insurance again and save my money. I travel often with my family of four and when I don't have someone dying in my family, they're very successful trips. Allianz are a typical insurance agency!! The status quo.",everything mother hospital fighting life bogus insurance doesnt cover purchased airline tickets november cruise set leave end july given option insure flight without different policies select one policy couldnt even read plan mother needing liver transplant march event needed cancel cruise plans transplant many complications instead canceling rebooked cruise end april asked airline change date april thought policy would carry tickets used mother likely make circumstances beyond control attempt trip good conscious may mourning loss loved one gave evidence needed icu doctors letters hospital insignia letter head email receipts american airlines theyre playing policy doesnt cover time period card stuck credit american airlines expires april spoke allianz representative kept regurgitating old line policy doesnt carry instead putting decision maker line attempting work answer told airline rebooked policy ended purchase new one probably would time knowing mothers future ive heard people never purchase fine print learned valuable lesson never purchase insurance save money travel often family four dont someone dying family theyre successful trips allianz typical insurance agency status quo

After spending 12 hours at the airport, sleeping on the ground in a snowstorm, the company reimbursed me only for what I spent on a cooler, chips, water and coffee. But I expected them to respond for the bad night I had due to the negligence and lack of communication from the airline. Calculating what they reimbursed me, it doesn't even come close to what I pay for insurance. I understand that for claims for Trip Cancellation it covered $833.99 and for Travel Delay Coverage $300 and I only receive reimbursement for the chips.

8196,Tami Danielle,4 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,"Four stars but very good travel protection. When purchasing any insurance one‚Äôs hope is the company honors its promise to pay valid claims, which Allianz did, and I thank them. Only giving four stars because the claim process is long (14 business days which equates to approximately three weeks), and the Claims app does not provide enough status details. The four options are: Claim Started, Being Reviewed, More Info Needed, Final Review, and Completed. Note the completed status fails to provide the amount approved and paid. Therefore I had to call Customer Service, which defeats the purpose of a self-help app. Otherwise, again, I am pleased Allianz honored its promise and paid my claim. I typically do not purchase travel protection because I‚Äôve always been skeptical and really had not considered travel interruptions, such as what happened in my case to occur.

8672,AP,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 20 2025,"I am extremely disappointed with my recent experience with Allianz Travel Insurance. I purchased their policy expecting peace of mind during my travels, but that was far from what I received.I submitted a claim after encountering a serious travel issue involving my travel documents, which disrupted my trip and incurred unexpected expenses. However, my claim was denied on the grounds that it was ""not covered.""
