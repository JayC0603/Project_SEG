1,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
2,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"
3,JY,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,We have purchased travel insurance with Allianz for every of our trips since Covid. The company has excellent customer service. Quick response to all our issues. It is a great peace of mind when we travel around the world knowing that Allianz will always be there to assist us.
4,DA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,My husband had unexpected open heart surgery that caused us to cancel a trip to see family in December.  We were able to get credits for our air but needed to cancel a non-refundable condo in theCA wine country.  Allianz reimbursed the fees that were assessed.Then a month later he needed another procedure that caused us to cancel a cruise!  Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.
5,KA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 19 2025,Very good offer for travel insurance & the costs are responsible
6,CB,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 19 2025,Allegiance cancelled my flight and you won‚Äôt refund me my money
7,MR,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 19 2025,What‚Äôs the purpose of getting insurance if theirs always an excuse from the airline as to why there was a delay. We should be compensated for delays over 4hours and again another disappointment with this insurance!
8,HT,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 19 2025,We bought the travel insurance not thinking we will actually use it. But it turns out our train was canceled due to weather and Allianz covered our flights and hotels cancellation fees.  The claim process was super easy.
9,DA,2 ‚≠ê,Mar 19 2025,"You don't know how good a travel insurance company is until you have a claim.And after this claim experience I would look at another travel insurance company next time.We had a claim because Royal Caribbean cancelled the stop at their Private Island.  Instead they parked the Icon of the Seas off the coast of West Palm Beach for 2 days.  There is no way access their Island without taking another cruise for $800 each.The cruise line gave everyone an official letter to submit to their travel insurance company to submit a claim.We submitted the claim online and it sat for 14 days no action and email from Allianz.  When we checked the status online--it said they needed more documentation to process the claim--but they never never notified us of such.  We uploaded the bill from the cruise line which they wanted again--same document submitted the first time still in their folder.  Had we not checked the status, the claim would still be pending because they do not let you know if they need more information--you are required to check the claim regularly and follow up with them.When you upload a new document it says it resets the time to 14 day for Allianz to review the claim.Now 30 days after we submitted the claim they paid us just $200 and mailed a check.It's really too low a payment because it would take $1600 for both of us to take a 3-day cruise just to see the private island.  The Icon of the Seas 7-day cruise costs $5000.00 for both of us not including air.I don't have confidence in Allianz that they would properly pay another more costly claim next time so I would look at another travel insurance company."
10,KC,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 19 2025,I'm thankful for the help you gave. I really didn't know what to expect. Very professional. And the app was easy to use. Thanks so much for giving me a full refund. I really appreciate it. I was very disappointed to not be able to attend my show. But this made me happy üòä
11,CN,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 19 2025,You didn‚Äôt do anything but ask for documentation which I no longer had so I will never buy travel insurance again. Thanks for the lesson. Only cost a hotel room I didn‚Äôt use about 240$
12,AM,2 ‚≠ê,Mar 19 2025,I did not receive full reimbursement for all my medical expenses
13,DO,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 19 2025,"We will never travel without Allianz insurance.  A few weeks prior to our cruise date, my husband had to have his gallbladder removed, which resulted in two more hospitalizations for complications. Filing a claim was simple. I simply had to upload the hospitalization summaries and a note from the doctor and we were fully reimbursed within 10 to 14 days."
14,CB,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 19 2025,Very professional! No nonsense always there to help you out if you have a problem. Would never use anyone else but ALLIANZ!!! The best in customer service and and care about there clients.

22,ST,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 19 2025,"We had a medical emergency in Mexico and were required to pay all bills upfront. When we returned home, I contacted Allianz, submitted a claim, and was reimbursed quickly. I am still waiting on my health insurance to indicate what they will cover, but was delighted Allianz came through!"
23,KR,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 19 2025,It took about a month for my claim to finally be done and it was denied. What is the point of me buying ticket insurance and I can‚Äôt even use it? It‚Äôs a scam.

30,SE,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 19 2025,I just got a generic email back. My question wasn't answered.
31,LS,2 ‚≠ê,Mar 19 2025,"It would be helpful if your evaluators would look at the submitted documentation before asking for things to be  resubmitted that you already have; secondly, I found it very offensive when you asked for a death certificate and police report, when neither applied.  And thirdly, communication was totally lacking; I had to followup and reach out to find out what was happening.  Overall, I was disappointed in the process, not the outcome."

While traveling internationally I had to use an Urgent care facility. I forwarded a claim in the easy to use Allianz App with proofs of treatment and payment.

67,KA,3 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,I don't like that I need to file a claim with medicare and my supplemental plan when you know they do not pay for out of the country medical expenses.

121,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
122,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"
123,JY,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,We have purchased travel insurance with Allianz for every of our trips since Covid. The company has excellent customer service. Quick response to all our issues.

Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.
125,DP,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,Would not allow me to cancel my trip now I'll be reporting this as credit card fraud when charges hit my account in April and you still won't get paid.

129,SG,3 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I renewed my insurance in plenty of time. After that, I received a notice that my insurance was due.  I called to make sure I was covered ( I was).  Then A week later I get an email saying my insurance had expired.  This is very concerning.  I know it has not expired but The notices keep me on edge.  Please update your system so it accurately reflects the current status of policies."
130,SJ,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,I haven't had to use the coverage but my sister used it and it was fairly easy. I like not having to purchase insurance on each trip.

132,JJ,2 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I was only reimbursed a couple hundred for the thousand I was out, for the flight delay that caused me to miss my bus.

138,TF,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"We are traveling in Vietnam, and asked Customer Service to confirm whether we would be covered if we rented a scooter (we have American motorcycle licenses). After several repeated requests and re-submitting our information, we have not received a response after 26 days have elapsed.  This makes us deeply concerned that if we have to file a claim that the response will be inadequate."

142,NA,2 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,I bought insurance believing my event would be protected. After submitting a claim I was denied coverage which is extremely frustrating.

143,RS,4 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,The use of the website was easy to use and informative. I was able to complete my claim easily. My response back was a little slower than expected but timely.
144,MC,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I am experiencing a lack of communication and assistance. I uploaded all the necessary information, yet the program keeps telling me that I haven't. The claims page isn't updating. I also received no explanation about why one claim is marked as ""closed"" and another as ""completed."" When I call for clarification, no one is able to provide an answer.I spoke with a woman who told me that I didn't have proof of a baggage delay, only a plane delay, despite the fact that the baggage was clearly on the plane and was also listed in the documents I submitted.Additionally, I have been trying to get my claim completed since February, but it still has not been settled or explained to me."

They asked very specific questions about why I had to cancel just to say ‚Äúwell Im not sure if that will be approved‚Äù and could not support me in anyway it made me consider why did I even buy the insurance. My claim did get approved but the experience was awful and would not recommend
156,JR,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I received no updates or any notification of progress via email or the website tracker and actually had to call to see the status of my claim. I was then told that my conflict was not covered by the insurance, even though I provided the documentation that was requested.

161,RA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,Fast and easy to use.  Reasonable price.
162,MA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,We have used this company before and highly recommend it as they are very responsive to our needs and provide great customer experience.

168,DE,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,Your templates are too locked down. You need more flexibility to communicate with your customers. Not everything fits in your templates. It‚Äôs quite frustrating and time consuming.

There was always an excuse as to why Allianz couldn‚Äôt or wouldn‚Äôt help. I found the insurance misleading and overall useless."
174,DC,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,Provided their required documentation and got our money back. Fairly easy process. Will always take out travel insurance.

176,BO,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,Smooth & easy to obtain the policy of travel insurance.
177,MB,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"First of all I have not received my refund. Second if families pay for the insurance and cancel at least 2 weeks prior to the event that they have insurance for a refund should be issued no matter what the situation is. To make it only for reasons that you describe isnt fair to the families. Emergencies come up and there isnt anything that can be done so if 15 days notice is given than a refund should be given no matter what. Its a shame that the company makes you jump through hoops just to deny your claim. To update my claim Allianz Travel Insurance Company is the worse type of insurance to get to protect your purchase. I was unable to attend a Soccer Camp due to a family emergency that left my family unable to get me to the camp. They denied my claim to get a refund. They kept my parents money even though I was unable to attend. The worse experience! Dont buy the insurance, not worth it they will find every excuse to deny the claim."
178,TF,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,I didn't have to pay enormous upfront cost for insurance just to travel.
179,HA,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"You didn‚Äôt review my claim and denied it based on an insignificant, irrelevant and random sentence in a multiple page claim."
180,KT,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"Pointless to buy if something comes up other than medical problems that need a not from a doctor even if its not for your own illness, terrible service and waste of money"
181,CT,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,Just knowing what I could expect if anything did happen while I was on my trip let me enjoy myself much more while I was away.

185,RK,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,Allianz is so easy to work with and they help with any missing documents. They really work hard to make the claim process as easy as possible. I doubt that I will ever use any other travel protection company again!!!!!
186,KC,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,"We purchased insurance for a soccer ID clinic and had to cancel due to a club soccer conflict, which was not deemed covered. Thankfully the school was great and refunded our costs however this was more hassle than it was worth."

188,RA,4 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,You were very helpful when my husband got sick and they told us where to go and how to turn in the receipts. The process for turning in the claim took a little longe than expected but once all the information was turned in we did get paid for our claims! I‚Äôd recommend using this ins every time you travel outside the country.

199,LH,4 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,Allianz was sympathetic with our travel issues. Glad we had the trip insurance to recoup some of the unplanned out of pocket expenses we incurred thanks to American Airlines. Portia was excellent to work with. Very thankful she was willing to text message me what was needed since I thought I had submitted the requested paperwork several times.
200,AB,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,They are always helpful and go the extra mile with patience

208,MD,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,Quick and easy
209,JA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,Couldn't go due to weather (driving). Getting the refund was really straightforward.  I uploaded some screenshots of weather maps as well as NWS warnings.  Took a few weeks for them to review my claim and then another week(ish) for the funds to be transferred to my account.  Since it's insurance I honestly expected a bit of a fight if not outright denial of the claim.  Didn't happen and would use this service again.
210,WA,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,I‚Äôm not sure why..You exist? My flight was delayed over 6 hours. I put in a claim and you told me my flight wasn‚Äôt delayed for even 4 hours. Not sure how you figure this out but if a flight is scheduled at 7pm and leaves at 1:03am 7+5 =12 add one more for good measure and it‚Äôs 6 hours at 1am.You basically can‚Äôt do math or the airline lied to you to save their ass. Either way - you serve zero purpose except to take people‚Äôs money. Done with you.
211,VM,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,"I got sick while on board a recent cruise and had to go to Medical for an exam and meds. I was charged over $300. Upon my return home, I went online and completed a claim with Allianz. It was super easy and I received my refund within a short time."

221,HM,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,"This coverage didn't see that a financial hardship wasn't a legit enough reason to help with a refund for the tickets. I can't afford anything in life right now, let alone the ability to book a flight from Wisconsin to even attend this trip, so now I have tickets that may/may not sell and I will lose out on the money that my family desperately needs right now. It's unfortunate that a very extreme reason to get coverage is through medical emergencies rather than an actual life/money emergency that doesn't allow attendance for the event. Really put a lot of effort and emotions into writing out my reasons with proof.. Just to get denied."

229,SG,2 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,I am disappointed in the coverage you provide. I purchased the insurance thinking I would be covered if I had to change my flights. I purchased a flight to service of a death but had to change flights due to a delay in services. Your insurance only covers certain criteria. I would not purchase your insurance ever again.
230,MK,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,Quick and easy process. Couldn‚Äôt believe that our claim was processed and paid in about 2 weeks.
231,JA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,I've had Allianz travel insurance for quite a few years- thank goodness never had to use it but grateful to know it's there in the event I do need it.  Renewal is super easy too!
232,JM,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,Flight insurance is a scam just like car insurance or medical insurance. What‚Äôs the point of buying insurance if you don‚Äôt get reimbursed for cancelling your flight?!?!
233,FM,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,"My last cruise I was on I had to visit the medical center. First thing I will say the medical center staff was fantastic. I made a claim for my visit to the medical center,after sending the documents my claim was approved. It was simple and quick. This is why Allianz is my choice for insurance when I travel."
234,DK,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,"Had an issue with a snow storm.  I filed my claim, submitted supporting documentation and I was reimbursed.  Very easy."
235,BS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,Staff was very helpful and case was settled quickly
236,Dazhona Younger,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,No hard to set up !
237,DC,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,"I had to go to the doctor in Thailand and paid in baht.  It was easy to make the claim in USD, and I was able to just take a photo of the receipt to send in.  Very surprised to have it in my bank account the next day!"
238,GR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,Unfortunately had to file a claim for my event insurance and everything went very smoothly. I‚Äôm grateful I trusted this company.

241,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
242,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"
243,JY,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,We have purchased travel insurance with Allianz for every of our trips since Covid. The company has excellent customer service. Quick response to all our issues. It is a great peace of mind when we travel around the world knowing that Allianz will always be there to assist us.
244,DA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,My husband had unexpected open heart surgery that caused us to cancel a trip to see family in December.  We were able to get credits for our air but needed to cancel a non-refundable condo in theCA wine country.  Allianz reimbursed the fees that were assessed.Then a month later he needed another procedure that caused us to cancel a cruise!  Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.
245,MM,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,Our suitcase arrived at our room on the cruise with a wheel ripped completely off . We managed to to get home  and I immediately file a claim on the app and submitted photos and paper work to the app .We put in a claim for the suitcase and we were notified that night the the claim was accepted and the funds would be placed in or checking account which it was . It was a great experience work with Allianz
246,HM,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,N/A
247,UC,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,"The purpose of purchasing flight insurance is to receive your money back in the event of an emergency. My father is receiving treatment for brain cancer and I lost my job the same month that I was supposed to take my trip. I sent all of the necessary documentation and have now been waiting almost a month for a ‚Äúdecision!‚Äù What decision?? I bought this protection for this purpose, I had no idea there were cases that needed to be considered‚Ä¶..and mine certainly should not be one of them!!!! Furthermore, I was promised the ‚Äúreview process‚Äù would take no longer than 10-14 business days, that‚Äôs a joke! I call nearly everyday, which is absurd. They should be the ones contacting ME!!!!"
248,DB,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,Our experience with Allianz was fantastic.  We bought travel insurance for an expensive trip to Antarctica.  I was unexpectedly diagnosed with an auto-immune disease that is triggered by cold weather one month before the scheduled trip.  The insurance filing process was fast and painless.  Allianz handled everything perfectly.
249,PH,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,"Allianz was great. They were so friendly, professional and easy to work with. They took care of my concert ticket refund so easily and my refund came back to me quicker than they said it would. The process was simple!!"
250,PJ,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,We paid for this insurance and ended up getting the flu and could not make the event. We did not go to the doctor because we knew it was the flu but could not get reimbursed for our tickets because we could not provide a doctor‚Äôs note. Scam
251,SM,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,"Your insurance is a great value, it takes care of basic mistakes aka accidents or scratches on my rental.  I have not used any of the other travel insurance items like loss luggage, etc, but the people I speak to are professional and kind to me.  I will always recommend and use your insurance program."
252,PD,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,"Easy seamless process, received response within 3 days. Worth the cost of the plan to protect your trip."
253,PA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,"Very fast conclusion, easy forms to fill out."
254,MT,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,"Well, I submitted all of my receipts and only got reimbursed for my flights. So, why do you make it sound like getting the insurance would help cover my trip when that is not true. I don't think I will be purchasing the insurance in the future if it picks and chooses what it wants to pay even with receipts and confirmations."
255,JP,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,Process was quick and easy to follow
256,JD,4 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,Took a lot to get to get reimbursed.. it did work out but had to get a letter from the dr .. but happy with the outcome thank you
257,SU,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,You respected my reason for canceling and refunded quickly
258,LC,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,I injured my knee on the dance floor. I went to the ships doctor and was given a wheelchair to use and had to purchase a cane. When I returned home I filed a claim for the over $200 bill I received from the doctor. Within a week I received a check that covered the entire amount of the bill. I have renewed our coverage for this year. The cost of your yearly plan is very comparable to the per cruise price offered by the cruise companies.
259,CS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,no issues at all with getting my refund.  fast service.
260,AP,4 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,I liked the tracker and document upload feature but wish there was better transparency about timing
261,MA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,"I always use alliance, they answer quick, are helpful if you have questions and need guidance in completing application. Last. But most important, they refund you quickly if you have all your info and meet their requirements. I had to cancel an event in Florida and I live in New Jersey due to unexpected procedure and I received my refund in 3 days. They are very professional."
262,CH,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,I was reimbursed for my travel difficulties.
263,BF,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,Working with them to get my refund was so easy. The customer service representative was very helpful and kind. I highly recommended this insurance for peace of mind.
264,MA,3 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,Took care of my needs but the claim and refund process is alittle to long for my liking.

270,YC,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,Quick processing of claims and quick step-by-step response
271,VH,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,"I enter my banking information for direct deposit and the company still sent out a check to an incomplete address. I received an alert advising a check was mailed after the fact. Then I waited 2-3 weeks to be told the check was sent to an incomplete address and would take 5-7 business day to cancel and then another 5-7 to process the direct deposit. They co firmed they had my banking information on file and would process the request for direct deposit. I now received a an email asking me to provide my bank information for direct deposit again, so hopefully this time there isn't any issues. All in all there has been a lot of back and forth and I still haven't received my payment. It's been over a month since the claim was filed. The app also doesn't work and they were not able to send me any confirmation emails from the calls that were made confirming what action was being taken."
272,CO,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,Absolutely unhelpful during difficult situation with ticket issue. Blamed purchaser instead of venue. No point  in using their service for any real servicing issues.
273,DB,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,"Your Customer Service is truly excellent. I made an error when initially signing up, your representative quickly resolved the issue and was so polite and professional it really set my mind at ease going with Aalianz for my travel insurance."
274,VN,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,The whole process was very straight forward and the resolution  came seamlessly thereafter.  Would highly recommend!

277,JF,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,A few hoops to jump through when filling a claim. But nothing I didn't have.Paid claim timely & in full.
278,NG,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,"I had to check coverage prior to a trip.  I was able to check online, and then call and get it all resolved quickly.  Great service!"
279,LG,3 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,"Filing a claim was quite frustrating because I was told by two or three Allianz associates that I needed to get a ""form"" from my tour provider and that all tour providers know what the form is. Eventually, I was told that there is no form but I needed xxx for documentation. That clarification could have happened much earlier in the process instead of me having to keep going back to the tour provider, asking for some form that he supposedly knew about, and then finding out that there was no form needed. Instead, I needed something else - something that I thought I'd provided once or twice already - but it was easy for me to provide so my claim was quickly wrapped up after that."

282,MG,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,everything went smoothly
283,DG,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,"They are not clear on what is covered with their insurance prior to purchasing it. Ticketmaster says they cover ticket errors, but this company has since said they do not.

287,MS,3 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,Using the website is a bit difficult. I was able to get some reimbursement for hotel and air for a 3 day stop of my tour (my trip companion fractured her pelvis) but no allowances were made for food.  I missed two scheduled tours because needed to stay with my trip companion until her family arrived and asked about reimbursement for the missed ports of call but none came.

294,JE,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,"Very easy, but seemed to take a while for the review. Overall the process was good. When filing it would have been helpful to have a guide for each category, such as trip interruption and trip delay, to determine what criteria has been met for each claim."

296,JM,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 17 2025,Allianz refunded the entire cost of tickets to an event my family and I could not attend due to a funeral for a very close family member. The refund process was quick and easy and they even offered condolences for our loss. The cost of insurance was very reasonable.

310,RB,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,Great customer service!! I received a quick response from the company and received my check in the mail very fast.

So we could not attend the concert that night. 8 tickets in Feb. When we called (The morning of the concert) to let them know we had no way to get there. The agent said,  This will be the easiest refund you will get all day.""We got refunds from the Belagio and Spirit airlines.

335,LE,3 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,I didn‚Äôt get the full refund. Thankfully I got some of it back but I still haven‚Äôt gotten my biggest amount back. My flight was cancelled and I couldn‚Äôt even go on the trip. I uploaded some documents I forgot to add about proof of payment and it still wasn‚Äôt looked at and says my claim is ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù. Soooo I uploaded them again to see what happens.

340,DA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,My husband had unexpected open heart surgery that caused us to cancel a trip to see family in December.  We were able to get credits for our air but needed to cancel a non-refundable condo in theCA wine country.  Allianz reimbursed the fees that were assessed.Then a month later he needed another procedure that caused us to cancel a cruise!  Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.
341,PK,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,N/A
342,DG,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,Everything went smoothly and quickly
343,RL,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,My experience was great because this company cares about your experience. Thank you for your caring and prompt reply in a short timly manner.
344,RS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,"Extremely quick turnaround to approve claimThe only issue is that I requested direct deposit, and I was mailed a check two weeks later"
345,SE,4 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,"I am happy with my annual travel insurance.  The only problem this year was that for one trip I needed a specific coverage that Allianz does not provide, so I had to hunt for that coverage elsewhere on top of my annual policy."
346,BM,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,It was not complicated to make the application for refund and my claim was processed in a reasonable amount of time.
347,CS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,"Great insurance, our baggage was delayed and we traveled from Miami FL to Riga Latvia in winter. We had no winter gear without our bags and had to purchase coats, boots, etc. we purchased. Submitted a claim and I had been reimbursed within 7 days.  Super easy and so glad we purchased it‚Ä¶.a must for international travel"
348,BM,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,If was relatively easy to file a claim and attach pdf files.
349,LP,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,Everyone I talked to by phone was pleasant and helpful. I did find the online application process difficult. Once I had all the necessary documents the process was fairly quick and I was happy with the settlement.
350,DW,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,"We had a small claim after a flight cancellation. It was easy easy to file a claim, download our receipt, and write an explanation of what happened. Payment arrived within a few days. Deposited into our checking account."
351,JP,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,Very easy to make an informed decision about your insurance needs. It leads you to feel safe and secure in your travels.
352,VI,3 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,Upon get the insurance I thought I would get a full refund but didnt
353,RL,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,"We purchased the insurance because we wanted to be sure that if we had to cancel the tickets we could get our money back. So to my surprise to be told that we would not be given our refund because it didn't meet the requirements that you guys have it place. If I would have know that there is only certain reason you would refund our money I never would have purchased the insurance. So we are out the money for the tickets and insurance. I could have at least tried to sell my tickets before the concert to get some of my money back if we would have been made aware sooner instead of the day after the concert, that we would not be receiving a refund. I feel like your company did this on purpose and this should have been handle differently. I am not planning on using this service again in the future."
354,LG,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,My claim hasn‚Äôt been resolved!
355,CM,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,I had no issues. Or need to use my insurance but rested peacefully knowing you would have my back.
356,CB,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,My trip to Europe was disrupted by missing the connection to Milan. I was diverted to BOLOGNA airport and incurred additional expenses to reach my final destination! Thanks God I subscribed a policy with Allianz! I got a refund of these expenses in a few days!
357,DA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,Great to have this service because tickets are so expensive  & life happens.
358,TF,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,I paid all that money to be able to get a refund on my tickets and turns out I didn't even get my refund. Money wasted and donated to someone's pocket but not mine.  I'm broke
359,EW,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,Buying this insurance is a waste of money.  Each time I purchase with the hope of coverage and I don‚Äôt get assistance and I am not covered.
360,TC,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,I am very disappointed that my claim was denied. I believe it was a totally wrong decision by Allianz.
361,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
362,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

365,DA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,My claim was easy to file and payout was moderately quick. I will go with this company anytime I travel. It is good to have the peace of mind.
366,MD,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,We love having the peace of mind by having travel insurance! You never know when an illness or accident will occur so it‚Äôs worth the small amount of money to know you will be reimbursed if something happens!!
367,MM,4 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,"Met expectations, comparidon between plans was easy."
368,LA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,Responsive.  Website is good and price reasonable.  Never had to file a claim which is a good thing.
369,NS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,"The ease of application, the detailed policy, the excellent coverage were factors in my review."
370,RG,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,Quickly handled and paid my claim for rental car damage
371,DP,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,Easy to choose the right package and price is reasonable considering the only way to truly know if I chose well would be if something went wrong.
372,JF,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,Very helpful customer information & service. Also a quick response/refund to our claim.
373,LM,4 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,The website was fairly easy to navigate and I was able to get my hotel paid for.

376,JW,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,"We recently had to unexpectedly cancel our trip within days of leaving due to a death in our family.  Allianz gave us a full refund, and they were great to work with. I will never travel without this trip insurance!"
377,OL,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,This company made getting insurance online as easy as possible
378,JK,4 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,"Everything went well, so we didn't need to tap insurance, but it did provide peace of mind."
379,KA,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,Not worth it. Didn‚Äôt even get reimbursed for a luggage fee that was already paid for changing my flight after my grandfathers funeral.
380,CA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 16 2025,N/A
381,AA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,My claim was processed quickly and efficiently. I‚Äôm very impressed with Allianz.
382,MP,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,"My luggage was stolen at debarking and the cruise line filled out the stolen bag report but I find out when filling my claim I needed a police report and receipts for my items! The form from the cruise was not even accepted as proof, really I can‚Äôt believe there is not a better process for stolen luggage. Now I don‚Äôt have receipts because I didn‚Äôt go shopping before my vacation anticipating my luggage would be stolen so my claim was not PAID!! Really that‚Äôs a shame you really don‚Äôt cover baggage Allianz is just taking people money. Funny how I always thought I was covered but I see I‚Äôm not and been using them for years of travel I‚Äôm pissed!"
383,Rabtog,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,"I have used Allianz multiple times.  Recently I had full insurance for a family trip.  One of us had to cancel for emergency surgery and the other three family members were delayed 26 hours when the airline cancelled their flight.  After 32 emails, only partial reimbursement was paid.  If you have travel insurance and are hospitalized and all the documentaiton is provided, why do they not pay within the policy limits.  They are happy to take your money but not compensate when appropriate.  Look elsewhere"
384,LZ,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,I submitted 2 claims and only one was completed and refunded the other still has not. And they were the exact same day and documents. No excuse.
385,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.

389,PH,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,My flight to Sgf was delayed by weather . The insurance covered my overnight lodging and meal. I called Allianz and told what was going on while I was waiting in line at American Airlines  to rebook the second leg of my trip. They told me what documentation I would need. I submitted the claim the next evening and reimbursement was sent to my checking account in less than a week.
390,DB,3 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,The slow process of evaluation
391,LC,2 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,"I had a flight delayed over 24 hours, and the all the questions and verifying my flight was delayed was too big a hassle to go through.  Alliance already knew my flight was delayed overnight as they notified me before I knew sitting in the terminal.  I am unsure how to even get verification of a canceled flight.  Anyways I found the system challenging."
392,KC,2 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,Advertising and the ease of adding insurance makes you believe they will cover more than just catastrophic. The limited coverage needs to be up front. And claims take weeks to get an answer back.
393,EJ,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,Very easy process
394,PS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,Our claim was handled fairly and quickly.
395,DC,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,This is my reasonable travel insurance for today's traveling situations!Good and clear insurance options with reasonable price.

397,MR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,Working with the staff at Allianz was easy and they are very accessible.  The process to submit documentation is easy and very straight forward.  I highly recommend them!
398,JA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,O everyone we dealt with was polite and professional. Answered questions and kept on top of the things I was missing to solve our claim.
399,RS,3 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,"It started as a 5 star review, however, I liked how they monitored my flights and identified a major delay that entitled me to a settlement and notified me of a settlement due on the policy.  However, it is now more than 30 days since the flight and no payment has been forth coming."
400,GG,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,"If I could give you zero stars, I would. We purchased insurance for a recent trip that we had to cancel due to a veterinary emergency, and because it was a health emergency involving an animal rather than a human, you declined it. It's unfortunate your Insurance company is in the business of defining what it means to be family and think you have the authority to decide that certain lives are more valuable than others."
401,TB,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,"I love Allianz policies! I use them for all my travel needs. Every time I travel, I feel safer knowing I have them. I‚Äôve had to make claims with them only twice, and both times, it was super easy. I could easily submit the documentation, and payment was quick. They are so much better than any of the other types of travel insurance I‚Äôve used."
402,BB,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,I'm so glad i had insurance for this trip!
403,EL,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,Very useful insurance and the customer service was very nice and understandable with my circumstances! I had to go to work in Canada the day of my show and I got a full refund!
404,LJ,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,I was decieve
405,ZA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,"Your team was very helpful, and did not give me the run around. And I got my money back easily, tbh this is worth it."

407,ER,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,N/A
408,NO,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,"Do not purchase Aliianz's trip insurance. It covers next to nothing, and anything that's slightly outside of their ""stated coverage"" is not covered. Absolutely heartless, greedy company that had no remorse for not covering a claim of mine that obviously should've been covered by any reasonable judgement. Will never use this company again for anything again in my life."
409,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.

Did not get any feedback for about two weeks. Finally had to call and learned that review process had stalled. Received payment on 3/13/2025, nearly a month after filing my claim. Website says claims will be reviewed and settled in 10-14 business days."

424,BM,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,"It was easy to use.  I always used this when my mother was ill, and I didn't know if I would beable to go on my trip.  So now I want to use it every trip"
425,MG,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,Allianz travel insurance made our cancelation stress free after we had to cancel our trip to Mexico .
426,SW,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,"I was under the impression that the insurance I was getting would cover my family not being able to go on that specific date, since it was a Christmas gift.  Oh well, $700.00 down the drain."
427,DA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,It was easy to renew my policy.

430,KA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,"I spoke with a representative who was knowledgeable, patient and kind.  I had so many questions and he had an equal number of easy answers.

431,AB,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,"The response times were extremely slow; I submitted the claim on February 22 and reached out with a clarifying question on March 5. I didn't hear back from anyone with that question, submitted via email. I replied to the email again on March 12, as my trip was booked for March 16 and I needed guidance. I finally heard back on March 14 that my claim was denied. I had booked for a conference; when the conference was cancelled, I submitted a claim. I was denied because a cancelled conference was not covered. I will tell everyone that I know to not use Allianz for travel insurance."
432,FK,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,"Whoever looked at my claim is saying it has to do primarily with the death of my father on January 9th, 2025.  IT DOES NOT.  The issue deals with my mother, who I am POA for and the help hired to care for her while I was going to be traveling quitting on me last minute.  I thought that was clear, and that my mother did become worse after the death of my father.  I sent a copy of my father's death certificate because you jerks always want proof of a family emergency or tragic event.  Obviously you also cannot read."

439,RH,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,"A couple months after purchasing our trip + insurance, my husband's gallbladder went bad and he couldn't travel.   Just uploaded the needed documents and my claim was immediately settled and paid.    I will always buy the travel insurance.  You never know what could happen."
440,BB,3 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,Claim was eventually paid without objection.  Trip was cancelled due to critical medical emergency of a family member.  I was asked to provide information as to the diagnosis and symptoms.  I submitted hospital records with that information however apparently the company does not have access to anyone familiar with medical terminology and did not acknowledge receipt of the information requested.  It took several phone calls before I reached someone to whom I could explain what the medical reports contained.
441,RA,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,"I booked travel insurance for my entire flight at the check out of buying my flight. This should have been enough. However, when I went to use it it was only applied to my departing flight not my return flight and of course I needed to use it for my return flight. I shouldn‚Äôt have to buy it with my flight and then go to the insurance website and check in and make sure the dates are correct. It should honor what it says at the flight booking check out. So dumb and sneaky on y‚Äôall‚Äôs part."
442,MM,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,Allianz handle my claim in a fast timing manner.  Very professional.  Thank you!
443,MO,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,It was extremely easy to file my claim. The claim was reviewed and settled in lightening speed. I highly recommend Allianz.
444,Ronnie Farr,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,"Filed my claim on 1-13 made several phones calls to inquire about my claim. You lost ALL of my back up had to resend all documents. Tiy sent a link to have funds go to my checking account, never happened.You created a check but voided it NOT by my request. Many more phone calls and spoke to at least 6 plus different people. Finally received a check . Check received early February."
445,GJ,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,Ease of aquiring the insurance thru your website. Never had to submit a claim.
446,ME,4 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,"I got my money back so I‚Äôm happy!  The reason for my request was because I had the flu and couldn‚Äôt make it to the concert.  In order to get a refund, I had to get a doctor‚Äôs note but you could clearly tell I was under the weather when I spoke to the rep.  I understand the need for written proof but when you‚Äôre sick, the last thing you want to do is get out of bed especially when you paid for this payment insurance protection.  I wish there was another way around this for someone who is ill."

448,MZ,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,It was our 1st experience having to actually use our travel insurance! We didn‚Äôt even know what it would cover! The process was easy and we got our check really fast! It made a bad travel experience a bit better! Thank you Allianz!

450,CO,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,I will no longer trust this company with travel insurance. My claim was denied due to unexpected incident. We have lost over $1000 and In process of appeal. Online claim is not user friendly.
451,CA,2 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,"On February 11th 2025 I received a call from Allianz asking for my medical report on this case. The caller said that once received, they could pay for my expenses. So I submitted what he was asking for. But for some reason Allianz was then saying that the expense was not big enough. However this was not an issue during the call. The only issue was the medical report, not the expense. I requested that Allianz provide me with that phone call recording and also that it reviewed it because this decision Allianz was making was wrong. They finally said they would reimburse me. It is not pleasant to travel abroad and be deceived by a company that is suppose to protect you. My son got sick traveling and I had to visit a doctor. And then Allianz gave me the run-around and took them 3 months to acknowledge my reimbursement. I will not use Allianz again nor recommend it."

453,EH,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,I had to cancel my trip to New York at the end of February.  I provided all of the necessary documents and other proof. It said that it would take 7-10 days for a refund.  This was on a Saturday at 11:15PM. By late Sunday morning I had my refund.

It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
458,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

Living in the Northeast i know things can be unpredictable with weather, etc. so i said what the heck and paid the nearly $150 to insure my flights.After my flights home got cancelled and i got stuck in my destination for two extra days, this policy didn't even cover half of the hotel bill.The policy (for two) cost $148 and the max they'll pay out is $300 total.Never again Definitely wasn't worth it"

Although Ticketmaster provides an option for ""insurance,"" and you pay for that ""insurance,"" Alliance will not cover the total cost; they paid $384 for a claim for tickets and upgrades totaling $568. When I questioned them as to why they did not pay the entire claim, I was told to read the agreement and that they were only responsible for $384.  Very deceptive."
479,DA,2 ‚≠ê,Mar 15 2025,Your plan didn‚Äôt help me when I had to upgrade my airplane seat due to a back injury. I paid the full upgrade fee.

We didn‚Äôt expect this time that something will happened on our last cruise that we need to cancel our trip. Alianz insurance made us  feel at ease because of this insurance we got all our money back even though o felt bad that i need to file a claim because its our first time to file. We don‚Äôt really wanna cancel the trip but mom died on the day that we‚Äôre supposed to cruise. The claim process is convenient, the agent help me file a claim, I submitted  all the required paperwork‚Äôs through  website and email. After a few days I called for a follow up and after the given time frame it‚Äôs all done and my claim was successful. Thank you so much, we will forever use this company and I always tell my friends and fellow cruisers to use Alianz for travel insurance."

525,KF,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 14 2025,I was taking my 85 year old father to his brothers funeral in New York. We missed our connecting flight out of Charlotte due to high winds. The next flight they could get us on was at 9:00 pm which means my father would have had to endure a 7/1/2 hr layover. At his age and health he could not have made it. My claim was denied.  I wouldn‚Äôt waste money on the insurance. It‚Äôs a scam

533,Amanda McCall,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 14 2025,"I normally don't get travel insurance but did for this trip because it was affordable and I thought what the heck. The insurance was through Allianz. Went on the trip and all was good until the end when a snow storm cancelled our return flight home. The airline we flew with was unable to get us back home for two days. I called Allianz and the representative I spoke with was very nice and assured me that I had enough coverage to pay for the hotel and food for both days telling me that I had $150 per person per day and there are 5 of us so good to go. Two nights in the hotel plus food in Fort Lauderdale totaled the max (that I thought) of $1500. Turned in claim with receipts. Claim paid $750. Called in and the rep I talked to this day said that yes, it says $150 per person per day but that is also the maximum. I said that is very deceiving policy language and even my husband who is a State Farm agent for 20+ years did not read it like that and their own representative who I spoke with prior to proceeding didn't read it that way and she basically told me there was nothing she could do so now I am stuck with the other $750 I was not expecting to pay. Does not leave a good tase in my mouth at all."
534,SJ,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 14 2025,i actually got my refund!!  the only thing i found difficult was the way the world is now with everything done on computers or our phones.  many of us as we have grown older do not understand what the younger generations seem natural and easy.  to us it is a nightmare.
535,DA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 14 2025,"We had a cruise booked for about 4 months when I got sick and was unable to travel.  Fortunately, we had taken out a AAA annual travel insurance policy with Allianz.  We filed the necessary paperwork and Allianz took care of the rest.  They were great to work with and settled the case in a reasonable time period and sent us our settlement.  Since we travel quite a bit, it's nice to know that we have Allianz behind us in our travels."
536,GD,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 14 2025,Responded to my request in a professional and timely manner.
537,MA,4 ‚≠ê,Mar 14 2025,"Nice to get some of our additional costs covered when our flight was cancelled at the last minute...but, our hotel bill was $600 and taxi $50 and meals $130 but only received $300 for room. Thanks anyway."
538,KD,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 14 2025,"If I could give you a negative number I would.  This insurance is useless. I bought the ticket with the insurance and found out once I arrived that my father died.  Due to the extreme circumstances around his death I had to change my flight home because the medical examiner took longer than expected and the military funeral was scheduled the day after my original flight was to leave.  So I changed my return home flight so that I could attend the funeral‚Ä¶called spoke to a representative to see what needed to be submitted, submitted the documents and after almost 3 weeks they declined my claim because they death certificate issued his date of death as the day before I traveled (even though his body hadn‚Äôt been found yet).   So I‚Äôm out $1000.00 on plane tickets and the representative I spoke to after the claim was denied was an a$&!!!! I ended up crying on the phone, yelled at the guy and ended up hanging up!! My claim number is 0010467302-001.   So I think your service and insurance was a HUGE waste of money and my time.  If I could give you a negative number I would!"
539,MW,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 14 2025,"I recently had to reschedule a flight due to illness.  Allianz process was very easy.  I was refunded in full for missed flight.  The customer service people I talked to on the phone were friendly and competent, very helpful.  Most importantly I got the $$$ back quickly and easily."
540,LC,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 14 2025,Company was not willing to make adjustments to account for the use of public funds. The reasons for refund as outlined in the policy did not include reasonable accommodations for life and current events.
541,DO,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 14 2025,"Unfortunately we had an experience on a cruise ship that led us to submit a claim covered by our travel insurance with Allianz.

542,SA,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 14 2025,Not worth it at all!

545,MM,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 14 2025,"This claim went off with out a hitch. Very smooth and no excessive back and forth communication. This was my second claim with them.

546,SG,3 ‚≠ê,Mar 14 2025,Wasn‚Äôt what I expected but I did get something back. They barely covered the hotel that I booked through the cancellation but they didn‚Äôt cover anything else.

I didn't realize that I was responsible to rebook the ticket and unfortunately at a much higher cost. Better off to maybe pay more for a ticket that you can change if something comes up.

595,JH,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 14 2025,Pay out what your contract says you pay. Instead of just paying what you feel like paying. all documents submitted to support my claim and I dont think they where even reviewed. You only paid about 1/32 of what you should have according to your contract. I called to ask why you said it would be reopened and reviewed and you never contacted me again. so you will be hearing from my attorney for breach of contract.

599,TH,3 ‚≠ê,Mar 14 2025,"My overall experience was fine.  The website was easy to navigate and submitting a claim was easy.  I am disappointed because I was on a ski trip when my bag got lost (for 3 days).  I had no underwear, no toiletries, no warm clothes, NOTHING.  Fortunately, I was traveling with my sister and was able to borrow essentials from her so I did not have to buy much, but I did need some things like goggles, gloves and a head/neck gator because she did not have extra.  Had I been traveling with someone else, or someone who wasn't my size, I would have had to buy literally everything from long underwear, to ski clothes, warm socks, plus clothing to wear after the slopes.  So I was surprise to find that I wasn't even reimbursed for the full cost of the goggles that I had to buy, nor was I given the opportunity to justify why I bought what I did."

615,KR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,"I did not think I would need to take out any type of insurance on a trip out of state, but I looked at the pros and cons with my health and all I could think about is if I had to cancel my trip, I was covered. Come to find out And sadly to say, I was on vacation my first day and I took a horrible fall . Allianz has had my back with all my ER.,medical bills and bills, that I while on vacation, only was able to go to dinner once.,I was not able to do anything that was planned.,I was unable to return home because of it cost three times the amount the flight. I was miserable. My entire trip was unable to do anything that that was planned, called Dr. and told me , that this situation I was in, was a loss & and they told me that I just needed to rest, to try a recovery as much as I could before I had to get back on the plane, 6 hr. Fight & 3 hr. Drive home.  on our designated date for returning home, Not to worry about leaving early, due to my falling and breaking my left arm, in 2 places with fractures, unable to do anything for myself for a whole six weeks even with my return trip home, I am going to physical therapy and still trying to heal, it's going to take up to 8 mths.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.  thank you to Allianz trip insurance., I've taken it out on the past and not needed it.  Well I had no idea that this is much needed.,with the doctor. Bill's are adding up. üôè‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©πüò≠.,"
616,NP,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,The entire process was quick and easy. I wasn‚Äôt able to make the concert due to inclement weather for a couple of days and the governor declared state of emergency.

623,TL,4 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,I was so grateful to have had this protection for my trip in February. I was so excited about getting out of the cold and going to Florida for the week when the unexpected happened and I came down with pretty severe flu-like symptoms. Nothing worse than being sick when you are supposed to be on vacation other than worrying about the financial strain of change fees and having to cancel tickets that aren‚Äôt refundable. Allianz helped put my mind at ease so I could truly rest. The only thing that kept my review from being 5 stars is the application process not having a way to save your information if you start the process and realize you need other documentation before submitting. I filled everything out and uploaded all of my documents but was waiting for a letter from my doctor and when I went back in to add it I had to fill it all out and upload everything else all over again. Nothing too terrible that wasn‚Äôt easily remedied just a slight inconvenience that keeps the service from being excellent.

658,TC,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,The call center in Mexico/India the examiners were  not helpful.  They talked down to women. I'm not certain if it's due to all the tariffs impacting their country.  These agents are loyal to their country.  You need to listen to more calls.  You will wander what happened to your business because they are not loyal to working for Allianz.  It was extremely difficult to get a live agent from your corporate office in Richmond.  I had to contact the travel agent from AAA to help bridge communications.

I have to constantly follow up for them to call back and claim they sent me an email requesting additional documents when they never did. I submitted a claim since 2/1/ and still waiting for a response. They requested additional documents, I sent the additional documents the same day and still have to wait 14 days for a response on one document. They advertise this as an easy way to protect your trip for peace of mind and then drag out a simple process and try to not pay out on a claim. Will not be getting in the future. At least not with this company."
678,LB,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,Filing claim was very easy and received the reimbursement quickly.
679,PP,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,We leave on our trip tomorrow and I have NO INFORMATION on this insurance
680,SK,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,The portal was easy to manage and the customer service was very nice!
681,BM,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,Submitted a claim no response but was automatically denied. If additional info was needed at least reach out. The train and cancelation are public info and I provided all that info. Stumping someone when they are down! That's what was done to me.
682,JT,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,It was relatively easy to submit a claim. Quick response and payment. I would use them again to insure long trips.
683,MB,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,"Easy to enter claim, quick response"

692,RA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,Made a claim for a flight delay which forced me to get a hotel room when I missed a connecting flight in Chicago. The hotel room was covered and was paid quickly once the back-up info was submitted online. Some of the canned messages sent through the online service were a bit confusing and requested info already provided.
693,JS,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,Claim still hasn't paid and response time has been unacceptably slow.  Will definitely think twice before purchasing or recommending that people buy trip insurance.  I was expecting an efficient response.
694,PK,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,Did not help me when my flight was delayed and I missed my connecting flight. I thought this was what it was for and would have been more helpful when I had to buy a separate flight to get to my location on time. They did not help me with any sort of refund or credit for the second ticket.
695,RF,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,"Very bad experience, I have a claim that I made since February 7 and to date it has not been processed and I have called several times, and the support has been very bad."

697,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
698,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"
699,JY,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,We have purchased travel insurance with Allianz for every of our trips since Covid. The company has excellent customer service. Quick response to all our issues.

700,DA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,My husband had unexpected open heart surgery that caused us to cancel a trip to see family in December.  We were able to get credits for our air but needed to cancel a non-refundable condo in theCA wine country.  Allianz reimbursed the fees that were assessed.Then a month later he needed another procedure that caused us to cancel a cruise!  Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.
701,AB,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,I am trying to get my claim paid. I have turned in the required documents. Still I am being asked for additional documents that don't pertain to my claim.I feel like this is a scam!!!

703,JD,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,"I called to ask questions and my questions were answered and good information and instructions given. I processed everything on line, easy and fast. Had my payment for my accident on board the sun princess in about 10 days. The experience could not have been better."
704,DA,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,"I have submitted ALL necessary paperwork.  It was NOT expected that her HS Basketball Team would make it to Semi-State, BUT they did;  PROOF of her on the roster, the location, and the time were submitted.  You STILL need more proof?!?!  This ""insurance"" is a scam and just another way for you to increase your revenue."
705,GW,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,I had a ride set up with one of my workers and we ended up having truck problems which led me to missing my flight.  They rejected covering the expenses for my flight. I purchase insurance on most every flight I book but have only needed it this one time and was denied.
706,AP,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,The insurance for rentals is cheaper than from the rental facility and on top of that if you ever need to change or cancel coverage they are super accommodating. Will be a return customer every time.
707,SU,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,Our flight was cancelled and we had to spend 40 hours waiting for our next flight.  We submitted our receipts and were reimbursed for all expenses submitted.  Tip:  use credit cards and keep receipts.

711,VC,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,I just proved the reason why I change my trip and they understand and help me with the refund inmediately.
712,ES,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,"Took a long time to get back to me about my claim 18 days, didn‚Äôt provide updates on it either. Wish it would have just said in the beginning when I bought it for my flight that something‚Äôs were not covered by the insurance plan because then I wouldn‚Äôt have wasted money on buying the insurance in the first place."

So we booked with United, we did NOT want to spend the night in an airport. There was a terrible ice storm in Syracuse the day we were supposed to get home.We were  originally supposed to get home at 10:00 pm.

744,AB,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,I thought the staff I talked to on the phone were very helpful.  Reimbursement of expenses on a qualifying delayed trip was within the time frame stated.I thought there was something wonky about either the wording of the way something on the electronic filing process in one spot made it so I had to give up and call to get it handled.

I submitted them and a week later, nothing. I can‚Äôt even trust that the info I was given over the phone is correct. I started this process on 2/19/25.When I had a flight delay I didn‚Äôt even have to initiate a claim. It was automatically done for me, so this experience is a little unsettling."

But to date, no call. Then Allianz sent me two surveys asking to rate my experience."
761,MI,3 ‚≠ê,Mar 13 2025,"I submitted my info and documents and never heard from them. I am out over $380 plus the money I paid for them to cover me in case something happened.

I appreciate that they reconsidered and followed their coverage policy after all."

791,RC,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 12 2025,"We were denied a claim stating you have a policy to not accept claims for weather. We get that, however, we had reasonable reasons other than the weather that were explained in our claim. The Governor of our State announced a ""weather emergency"" and informed people to stay off the roads due to extreme ice conditions. My wife and I are 69 years old and we live on rural mountainous roads that lead to the airport. We had to follow the emergency advice. Using a blanket ""policy"" as your primary reason to deny claims without an elderly person's safety is sad and inhumane.  I must assume your company would be fine with us attempting to get to the airport on rural roads at 3:30 AM during a weather emergency. We will no longer do business with your insurance company when obviously a failure to make policy exceptions for individual cases. The lack of empathy is obvious."

If you have such stringent rules on why trips are cancelled, you should make consumers well aware.  You did not do this, you sold it as if it would cover any type of cancellation.

846,MW,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 12 2025,Your company runs more like a collection agency than anything else and made it obvious that you don't care about people. I was due a much larger settlement on my claim. When I would call I would be given the run around and someone would close the claim after my call and you company never tried to reach out to me once to help settle the claim appropriately. I'll never chose Allianz again.

I had to cancel and attempted to use the ticket insurance but It was completely bereft of any customer service. I lost all the money I paid for both, even though I PAID FOR THE INSURANCE. I tried to make a claim, but the process was preventatively convoluted and impossible to utilize. You have taken my money, and you will claim I did not follow the instructions in the time required. Since I paid for the ticket insurance, and attempted to claim the refund before the performance, I ought to be expecting to be compensated. But I won't hold my breath expecting any integrity from a crooked racket of an ""insurance company"" as yours. Will certainly NOT recommend and intend to actively dissuade anyone from considering patronizing your rotten scheme."

Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
914,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

921,RI,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 11 2025,"Very prompt and courteous customer service: the team members are all serious and very professional.

932,TC,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 11 2025,It has been a hassle trying to get a refund when I purchased trip insurance. I had to upload documents twice and am still waiting to hear back. This is ridiculous for trying to use my trip insurance I purchased.

Customer Service Rep gave me a list of affiliated hospitals and doctors with address and phone number. And it helped me a lot. I was seen by a doctor and was treated. Allianz representative called me up to get the status of my health condition. On the following day, the Allianz representative called me up again until I got back in the U.S., they were still calling me for an update of my condition. That I think, was a very good service!"

They also have customer service personnel who will help walk you the steps. I have been very pleased and will continue to use them.
957,Cathy Wiggin Hansen,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 11 2025,Easy to get a quote and a copy of my policy.  Like the app also
958,AM,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 11 2025,One of my passenger had an emergency and they denied my claim. It‚Äôs a waste. Make sure to read and you probably need to upgrade to get help.
959,CD,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 11 2025,Many reasons why I will never use this company again. The customer service line is aweful the person who answered my call mumbled and did not speak clearly and hard to understand. Kept me on hold for 10 minutes. The reason my request was denied was not the reason I cancelled my trip. I cancelled my trip due to the weather and found it unsafe for me to drive on the roads. I was recently stuck in January when the ice storm came through then and did not want to be stuck in the same situation. Insurance is a scam.
960,MI,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 11 2025,"Easy upload of requested documents. Quick turnaround, the ability to follow thru the app what the status of my claim was. Very nice Thank you"

968,KP,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 11 2025,This company is the biggest scam and waste of money ever. I can never get a refund even when I submit multiple documents of evidence. You will never get my money again!!!
969,VC,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 11 2025,Save yourself the trouble and don‚Äôt fly with Allegiant. Theres almost always some sort of drastic delay and you‚Äôre likely to spend more money in the end or get home at ridiculous hours.
970,DR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 11 2025,People were helpful. I was trying to do online and couldn‚Äôt get past a certain point. I called and he finished it up online and got me a claim number and told me what I needed.  Since I am not good with computers I had to mail in the information needed for the refund. Was notified by email that it was accepted and received the payment immediately. Thanks.

974,WL,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 11 2025,"Well, let me tell you if you do get this insurance make real sure that you can get an excuse for the exact day that your trip started on or that your event started on other than that you aren‚Äôt getting your money back"
975,LA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 11 2025,Clear explanation of the process. I was most impressed to have an e-mail from an Allianz reviewer reassuring me that things were working as they should.
976,FO,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 11 2025,"The Allianz process was super easy and simple.

977,KP,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 11 2025,easy process. took less then thirty days for refund. I would definitely use again

989,KG,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 11 2025,"I had a terrible experience with Allianz Travel Insurance and cannot recommend them to anyone. American Airlines lost my baggage for three weeks, and despite filing a lost baggage claim immediately after landing, I received zero compensation and awful communication from both AA and Allianz.AA kept sending misleading updates: ‚ÄúYour bag is on the next flight‚Äù (nope), ‚ÄúYour bag is at the airport‚Äù (nope), and then two days later, ‚ÄúWe are actively looking for your bag‚Äù (also nope). Because of these false updates, I waited two days before purchasing replacement items, assuming my bag was arriving soon.I submitted my claim to Allianz with all required documentation‚Äîreceipts, screenshots of misleading AA messages, and my claim details. I heard nothing from them. After two weeks and 13 business days, I had to call them myself to check the status. The response? ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs in review, they should call you.‚Äù My claim wasn‚Äôt even being reviewed until I followed up.Three days later, I finally got a call‚Äîjust to be told my claim was denied! The reasoning?My baggage was eventually returned (three weeks later, after I called Allianz).I didn‚Äôt buy replacement items the next morning after my flight‚Äîas AA was telling me my bag was on its way.The customer service rep also had the nerve to tell me I should have adjusted my coverage‚Äîwhich isn't even an option when purchasing through AA‚Äôs website. Six weeks later, my claim is still in ‚Äúfinal review,‚Äù but I was already told verbally that it will be denied.Allianz Travel Insurance is a scam‚Äîthey dodge responsibility and refuse to pay legitimate claims. Save your time and money, and go with a better travel insurance provider."

993,JR,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 11 2025,"Insurance companies lie. They never actually pay for what they insure, even if you are due payment.Edit: if I had more time than I have money, I would take them to court, and I would win, but what I had insured is just not worth it. I was due money, as what happened was covered according to the terms I was provided, but it wasn't enough money to spend more time on it."
994,NJ,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 11 2025,"So far, so good. Haven't left yet, but we'll see and hope I don't have to use your insurance."

By the time someone finally replied with a final decision, Allianz said they could do nothing for me. No one informed me that I had to file a claim through the airline. My travel agent said to file the claim to Allianz that's why I paid close to $700 for insurance. Very disappointed with this company and it's communication. No transparency with this company. I'll never use this insurance for travel again.In response to Allianz response, my luggage was damaged. I sent pictures to them and I was told they don't cover damage to luggage. Now, I'm stuck with luggage that have missing wheels.  I was not looking to cancel the policy....there was nothing to cancel. The issue occurred upon my return home. The luggage were delayed and when they were delivered, wheels were broken off.  After about 2-3 weeks of me submitting the claim that's when someone from Allianz called me and said this claim is not covered by Allianz but the airline itself. Thanks for letting me know 3 weeks after the claim was filed but no thanks to Allianz for helping in this matter."

I cannot pay for things- like airline or concert tickets and not get help with it if something happens out of my control like plane delays of 8 hours or the airline breaking the wheels on my suitcase - telling me I don't need to say anything until the last leg of my trip and found out I couldn't even use my suitcase that was damaged - had to buy a new one!

1104,Roger Long,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 10 2025,I‚Äôve purchased Allianz insurance many times over the past decade. I‚Äôm 78 and have had some health issues and I consider it to be buying peace of mind. I‚Äôd never had need to file a claim but assumed I‚Äôd have to jump through lots of hoops if I ever had to file. It happened. I had a minor stroke and a few days before a 5 hour flight the doctor said I couldn‚Äôt fly. I sent Allianz a copy of by flight charge and the notice from my doctor one day before the flight date. The day after the flight date the full bill amount was refunded and electronically deposited into my checking account.

Seriously, if this primarily a medical policy, then market it as such. When you are paying $50 insurance to get $150, that's not insurance, that's a waste of my time and money."

1232,AJ,2 ‚≠ê,Mar 09 2025,"Normally I purchase insurance just in case of some unfortunate circumstances that can happen. This time around a lot happened. My flight was delayed 2 times, we boarded the flight, had to deplane because of a gas leaking from the engine and the odor got onto the plane, delayed until further notice and then I was rebooked for a next day flight which I could not do. I ended up getting booked for another flight just for it to be delayed as a red eye and I basically spent over 11 hours in an airport in a wheelchair. The only thing the insurance had insurance covered for was partially my meal. Maybe I didn‚Äôt understand clearly what this company covers but I assumed it covered delays or expenses incurred (food) which I had screenshots of emails from Delta stating I was delayed multiple times and even my flight was cancelled. I‚Äôll have to think twice now about using this insurance for traveling as I feel like I wasn‚Äôt fully covered."

All I could do is select a new policy, not just renew my existing. The telephone options I could find got me nowhere and I am calling from a cruise ship. Not hanging out on the phone to figure it out. I have a new policy. That‚Äôs fine. But would sure rather have renewed my existing. Now I get a notice my policy is expired. Hoping it‚Äôs just the original policy"
1383,Larry Burton,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 08 2025,The policy covered us for the whole year and all our travels. Claims seemed to be easy to use. It fits our lifestyles.
1384,JS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 08 2025,"I purchase Allianz insurance every time I travel abroad. Only twice have I needed to use it, once for a dental emergency and once when I needed a separate hotel room away from my travel companions because I had Covid. Both times I was fully reimbursed for the cost. I had trouble figuring the application out for the hotel room but someone on their staff walked me through it."
1385,AE,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 08 2025,"Hassel free process, nothing like Generali where you have to jump through hoops and they basically want a DNA sample from you. They gave back the exact dollar amount and it was a simple process. Wish they were still doing it through Priceline!"
1386,BB,2 ‚≠ê,Mar 08 2025,I keep getting automated reminders and I have responded and done the needed steps and it doesn't resolve the issue. Difficult to talk to a human.

1392,KI,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 08 2025,We have not had to use the insurance but it gives us peace of mind knowing we have it.  I have a friend that did have to use hers and she got great help and was satisfied with the outcome of her claim.  So I am hoping if I ever have to make a claim it will be handled promptly and to my satisfaction.
1393,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
1394,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

Allianz reimbursed the fees that were assessed.Then a month later he needed another procedure that caused us to cancel a cruise!  Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.
1397,KO,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 08 2025,Did not reimburseme for 7 hour delay. This felt unfair and like a total scam.
1398,CS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 08 2025,Very easy to work with- gave us directions while we were in Mexico and saved our receipts accordingly. Reimbursed in a timely manner. The representatives were very patient and followed up for any traveling needs.

1401,BG,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 08 2025,you charge someone else's credit card for my insurance and refuse to correct your mistake. your customer service is horrible.
1402,DB,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 08 2025,I paid for insurance and received no support. I booked a trip to Riu Montego Bay via JetBlue Vacations from 1/3/2025 to 1/7/2025 with a group of friends. One of my friends was assaulted at the resort and the resort prematurely ended my stay even though I was not involved. The resort refused to provide a refund or written explanation claiming I would need to contact JetBlue or my insurance since I did not book with them. Allianz has refused to refund the balance of the unused dates at the resort. Don't purchase insurance from them it makes no sense.
1403,PM,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 08 2025,Amazing quick response and easy to work with when we had to cancel a vacation at the last minute due to a medical issue.
1404,KH,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 08 2025,I had an issue where the only babysitter we have to watch our children had a family emergency. She couldn‚Äôt watch our kids and we couldn‚Äôt go to the concert me and my wife paid for. You guys ask for documentation that we don‚Äôt have because it‚Äôs none to give.

1446,CP,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 08 2025,I purchased insurance for 2 tickets to a basketball game. I have a now 3 month old and a 5 year old. My daughter was 2 months at the time and this would have been me and my husband's first time out since she was born to celebrate his birthday. The day of the game the 5 year old had a fever so we had to stay home. We didn't take him to the dr because they wouldnt have done anything but told us to give him Tylenol to try to break his fever. When I spoke to a representative they said that a receipt for the medication was fine. I sent that in and my claim was still denied. Would never use them for insurance again. I'm out over $200.

My mistake was not checking the date of the concert we were going to see.  Another outting had been scheduled for that weekend with the family, which I was not notified of until after I made the purchase.  Now we are stuck with these tickets we won‚Äôt use.  It‚Äôs my fault, but these are the reasons people purchase insurance to be covered.  Well they didn‚Äôt cover the tickets for a refund and here we are."
1507,MA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,Guidance from the person I spoke with to ease in filing the claim.  Also the quick turn around time in receiving a reimbursement.

1513,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
1514,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"
1515,JY,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,We have purchased travel insurance with Allianz for every of our trips since Covid. The company has excellent customer service. Quick response to all our issues. It is a great peace of mind when we travel around the world knowing that Allianz will always be there to assist us.
1516,DA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,My husband had unexpected open heart surgery that caused us to cancel a trip to see family in December.  We were able to get credits for our air but needed to cancel a non-refundable condo in theCA wine country.  Allianz reimbursed the fees that were assessed.Then a month later he needed another procedure that caused us to cancel a cruise!  Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.
1517,EM,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,Was very easy to submit a claim and proof. Processing was fast as well.
1518,SA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,You made it easy and I appreciated the rapid response
1519,PM,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,"We had to cancel our trip at the last minute, my wife hurt herself and there was no way she would be able to make the trip.  The airlines wouldn't refund our tickets so I submitted a claim, filled out all the paperwork and within a few days the insurance company replied and paid the full claim.  To be honest I was a bit surprised.  But they were very understanding and quite nice."
1520,SA,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,"Poor communication throughout the process, tried to call in and get additional details because the event was coming up so if we weren‚Äôt getting a refund we could try to sell our tickets. Days after I submitted the reasoning we had to miss, and the documentation, and after the event had passed, I was told the reason was not an approved reason. Why not say that when I initially submitted the documentation? You waited until after the event so I‚Äôm just out the money so ultimately it was a waste of my money to purchase the insurance and a waste of my time to submit the claim. I hope in the future if the reasoning and documentation isn‚Äôt an approved reason that you‚Äôd let someone know right away, rather than wait an additional 10 days and after the event had passed."
1521,RB,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,They were efficient in our claim and we will use again on our next trip.
1522,AN,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,"We requested a refund through you guys, got it, provided all documents necessary, yet yall decided after about a week to just take the money back with no communication, not even to let us know if we maybe forgot a document. Terrible. Do not use this company."
1523,GA,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,"Big promise of coverage. Buyer beware!! read the fine print - $90 limit. I spent over $450 for two tickets, and parking got reimbursed for one ticket only for $90."
1524,JB,4 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,"My annual travel policy was easy to research and everything seems easy in the case that we would have a claim. We had the policy for the past year (with no claim) and happily renewed it for the upcoming year. I only gave 4-stars because, as with any insurance arrangement, THE TRUTH WILL BE IN THE CASE THAT WE WOULD HAVE NEED TO FILE A CLAIM. Hopefully, we won't have that need, but that's what it would take to award the 5-star."
1525,IW,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,We had to cancel our trip due to medical reasons; Allianze covered the cancellation after appropriate documentation from our doctor. The process was done online and straightforward.
1526,RG,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,My questions about the charges were answered fully and professionally.
1527,BF,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,My claim was not considered an acceptable reason. I thought the insurance protected me from a cancelation in case plans changed. I still got a credit from the airline. I can't see any reason why I would purchase insurance like this again.
1528,JW,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,Fast response and great
1529,J.,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,Received updates to completion was great.

1531,LJ,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,Comprehensive and fairly responsive.
1532,MA,4 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,"I got great results. HOWEVER< I did not see any way to talk to a real, clear speaking human option anywhere. If it was there, it was buried. PLEASE, do not let the human factor fade away. ALL of corporate America need to understand the absolute Necessity of Human Contact - and we Have to be able to understand their English."
1533,BM,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,the decision was made quickly on the status of my claim and was paid out soon after.

1541,RS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,I found it easy to customize the coverages I wanted and the price was competitive with other carriers. I travel internationally a few times a year so medical emergency coverage and emergency medical transportation was a big focus and I found Allianz's coverage limits adequate and affordable.
1542,SP,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,Very good service.
1543,RE,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,"We had to cancel our vacation due to medical reasons. When we canceled the trip with jet blue, they filed the claim with the insurance company.

1546,JM,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,"Purchased the insurance after my initial ticket purchase.  Had to call the company and speak to someone which took about 45 mins, but I was eventually able to purchase the insurance.  My vehicle was involved in a safety recall and was at the dealership attempting to get it resolved which caused me to miss my event.  Reading reviews online and through Reddit did not get my hopes up... However, after filing a the claim and including pictures of the recall notice and proof of purchase I was able to get my money back roughly a month after missing my show.  Much appreciated, thank you."

1549,FJ,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,"A dismal experience. It took about a month and half a dozen calls after I submitted all the documentation on line, following all the instructions,  just to get my claim wrongly denied. Your phone service is dismal. After navigating an endless menu, calls are answered by a call center where employees only read from a script, without understanding of my issue. Repeatedly, I got emails demanding the documentation I had already sent. When I finally was able to talk to people in the claims department (three calls at different dates after not getting the messages/calls I had been promised), I had to go through the whole description of my claim as if for the first time. Although some of these individuals agreed I had a case, I finally got a notification my claim was denied. I am still trying to get some help from the cruise company I traveled with in order to solve this issue. Please improve your customer service and make sure the reasons for a claim and the needed documentation are fully understood by your employees in charge of phone service. I have bought insurance before with Allianz but this is the first time I submitted a claim. This has been a tremendously frustrating experience and a waste of my time and money."

Meanwhile I would like to buy more coverage from them, but wont do it until this problem is resolved."
1625,CK,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,We called because the flight got canceled. We called Allianz to get advice. We were told we had $500pp changed protection of.

It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple.

I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
1634,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

1688,SP,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 06 2025,You guys are aweful. This happened twice now that I bought your insurance to protect my ticket prices for shows in case something happens. This time it was a medical related issue for which we couldn't make it and you guys denied the claim. Never ever buying anything from you and telling all my friends that these kind of insurances are useless and no one should pay for them
1689,TH,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 06 2025,The entire process was simple. Signing up for the insurance & filing a claim were both very easy. The claim was handled quickly & was all done online. I‚Äôm glad I chose insurance w Allianz-would recommend to anyone that buys concert tickets.

1695,AP,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 06 2025,I had a trip interruption and you helped out greatly. I just submitted the information that was required and it was a very quick and easy process. I would get trip insurance every time. Highly recommended.
1696,JR,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 06 2025,I thought I was purchasing trip interruption insurance.  Our trip was severely interrupted because of the hotel we booked messed up our reservation.  We could not stay at our chosen hotel and the places they could find for us were spotty at best.  Plus when we could not get a room for our final days we had to change our flight home and also pay extra money.  I filed a claim but was told we were not covered.  Won‚Äôt purchase the insurance again.
1697,GO,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 06 2025,At first i thought it was going to be a long and painful process to do but once i figured it out it was easy!I sent paperwork and flight info and everything was submitted and funds were deposited into the account.
1698,SJ,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 06 2025,They waited 3 weeks after I filed my claim to tell me I wasn't covered then state I had 10 days to ask for a refund. This company is a joke don't buy the insurance

1703,SA,4 ‚≠ê,Mar 06 2025,"I gave the rating as shown because I have only ever purchased Allianz insurance protection for flights and tours. I hope I never need to contact Allianz for help. But if I ever do, I hope Allianz will do everything that‚Äôs promised without a struggle on my part. If that day comes and Allianz comes through for me as promised, I will give Allianz the top review possible!!"
1704,NU,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 06 2025,"The parameters for them paying out insurance is for natural disasters, weather or death only. I had to change flight plans and it cost me hundreds of dollars to do so. I was told  because it wasn‚Äôt weather related I was SOL. I  wouldn‚Äôt waste my money on this again. If you do get a policy, make sure you read the fine print with a microscope before you spend money."

1711,CR,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 06 2025,Stop confusing people that it is for the price of the ticket if it gets canceled but you mark it as delay and only pay 75$
1712,VW,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 06 2025,It‚Äôs pointless to purchase the insurance if you can‚Äôt file a claim to get your money back for a flight that you can‚Äôt go on due to having to work. All of this was explained and itinerary sent and still was denied a refund. Spent money to protect my plane ticket and was not even given a refund for it‚Ä¶POINTLESS
1713,KA,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 06 2025,Allianz is not very transparent about what kind of information they want and how it needs to be presented.  There have been multiple phone calls clarifying this.  Customer service doesn't know what is needed.  They have a physician statement form to be completed but I was told they didn't.  They didn't always understand that three claims were all related to one medical issue prior to travel.  Managers don't talk with customers and each customer rep says something different than the prior people I had spoken to.  A frustrating experience and I am not done yet!

1774,GV,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 06 2025,"Allianz has unjustly denied my legitimate insurance claim, and to make matters worse, the representative I spoke with was absolutely cold-hearted and cruel. Instead of offering any real assistance or empathy, she spoke to me with a condescending tone, dismissing my concerns as if I were nothing more than an inconvenience. I expected professionalism and at least a shred of human decency, but instead, I was met with apathy and a complete lack of compassion. It‚Äôs infuriating to deal with a company that gladly takes your money but refuses to honor its commitments when you actually need them. In the end, I had to eat the cost myself, making me wonder why I even bothered buying insurance in the first place. This experience has been nothing short of frustrating, and the way I was treated on that call was downright unacceptable."

The second part of my claim states it is waiting documents but, they have been uploaded.   This survey is the first contact I have had since the initial email that I submitted  the claim.  What is going on?  Do they need more info?  Are they slow paying?  Why would I choose it next time if they can't reachout to ask for relevant documents?Where do we stand and what do they need to approve the claim?"
1860,BV,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"Quick and easy, had a question and the lady who helped me on the phone was able to get my questions resolved!"
1861,MK,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,Online information was clear. Materials (policy guidelines) were mailed to me. Thank you.
1862,CU,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,Couldn‚Äôt believe I payed 30 dollars for insurance and I was unable to go to my concert for family reasons and showed proof and everything and I was not able to get a refund worst insurance company ive ever seen WHAT A JOKE OF A COMPANY!
1863,JC,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,Very helpful
1864,TA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,Same great service year after year when we renew our annual policy.  Totally relieved the stress of traveling throughout the year!

1866,Nancy Barnes,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"My flight was cancelled and I had to reschedule the next day. Because I had to get a hotel room, I submitted my claim when I got home. Reimbursement was received within 3 days!!! Excellent service!!!"
1867,KL,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,Very easy to submit claim and received payment immediately.
1868,SS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"During our trip, and before our flight home, my 8 year old had a medical situation that put her in the hospital for 5 days.   Meaning we could not fly home on our original tickets.Allianz was true to their promised coverage and covered the cost associated with both of the flights - the flight we missed, and the one we had to rebook.We are very glad we had taken out this insurance on our trip."
1869,GI,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,Was really surprised how easy my claim process went. I had a medical diagnosis that caused me to cancel my trip. Had to send in my airfare receipt and two medical documents. That was it and I got a very prompt refund for the full cost of my and my spouses fare.
1870,CA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,Easy to complete application & quick turnaround for the refund.
1871,VA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,I am glad to have bought Allianz insurance for my travel that got delayed by 24 hours because of an European airline delay and missed connection. I had to spend the a day in an expensive transit hotel as I did not have a visa to get out of the airport. The airline declined to reimburse even the expense citing a lame reason that my origin and destination were both non EU locations. I submitted my claim to Allianz with all supporting documents. My claim was settled in week.
1872,AK,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,We had an unexpected emergency and could not attend our event.  A simple claim got us reimbursed for the event tickets. The process was quick and easy and no hassle at all.
1873,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
1874,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"
1875,JY,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,We have purchased travel insurance with Allianz for every of our trips since Covid. The company has excellent customer service. Quick response to all our issues.

1876,DA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,My husband had unexpected open heart surgery that caused us to cancel a trip to see family in December.  We were able to get credits for our air but needed to cancel a non-refundable condo in theCA wine country.  Allianz reimbursed the fees that were assessed.Then a month later he needed another procedure that caused us to cancel a cruise!  Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.
1877,SA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,Easy to use website. Insurance can be purchased well ahead of the travel dates without loss of time on the account.
1878,SS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"I submitted what i considered a simple claim for minor damage to a rental car with the documentation confirming the rental, repair bill and incident description. Allianz viewed it the same way and promptly reimbursed my cost. Couldn't have been easier."
1879,VA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,I didn‚Äôt know how to go about this and so I called. I got the nicest person who helped me and answered all my questions. The app is easy to use and to upload needed documents. My claim was processed really quickly. I am so glad that I had taken out insurance on our tickets! Thank you for a great experience!
1880,RS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,Allianz is a very reputable travel insurance company. It handles travel insurance claim very promptly and efficiently.
1881,LI,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,Unfortunately we had to file a claim due to an accident that resulted in us canceling our trip. The ease of filing our claim was amazing. And the reimbursement for our expenses was processed swiftly in a couple of days. Thank you!

1886,DD,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,N/A
1887,MA,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"I got this insurance with the expectation of convenience. It has been far from convenient!I filed Feb 12 and it‚Äôs march 5, I find it ridiculous that each time they request a document and you submit it- it starts the 10-14 day waiting process all over again.I would not recommend this service due to it being a hassle trying to get a refund through the ticket insurance provider."
1888,JD,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"Your information was misleading. I took this insurance out in the event that my husband and I could not attend a concert at Elevation 27. I saw nothing that stated if there any reasons in our schedule which prevented us from attending would preclude us from receiving our money back. That was the entire reason I paid for this insurance. We were planning on going and then his job had an unscheduled trip that he was supposed to go out of town which is the reason I put on your paperwork. However, I got sick and he stayed home and we weren‚Äôt able to go. I have Lupus so unexpected illness occurs. I was also disappointed with the ridiculous amount of time it took to deliver the news that you were not refunding my money when your policy stated 5-7 days. It was over a month. I called this week and quite literally while talking to a representative who was telling me that it was still being processed, I received an email notifying me I was denied. That was suspect in my opinion. Your whole company seems like a scam and suspect and I would never recommend you to anyone as I feel that my money was just stolen."
1889,EA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 07 2025,"I am always nervous that when I rent a car in the Republic of Ireland that they will not accept any coverage but their own. There were no issues with Avis accepting this policy in SNN and since local car rental Irish insurance is expensive this was a considerable saving. I still had to pay Avis a ""decline coverage charge"" (around 20 Euro) which I didn't appreciate and they took a 5,000 reserve on my credit card (so make sure you limit is high enough)"
1890,SB,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,I submitted all the necessary documents and the refund was given within two weeks. Thank you!
1891,TE,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,N/A
1892,KT,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,It has been 3 weeks and the review hasn't even been finished. The event I have tickets for is this week and it makes it hard to sell not knowing if I am going to be refunded or not. Not sure why it takes 3 weeks for a pretty straightforward situation.
1893,IM,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,N/A
1894,Eric Roelofs,3 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"The payout of the claim took too long.  Took over a month to pay out a very straightforward claim.  If you want the insurance industry to get a better reputation, please pay out real claims in a more timely fashion.  You cash the premiums immediately."
1895,DB,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"Could not cancel the order the day after or the night of, very very upset with this whole thing !!!!!"

1901,CH,4 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,I was very late in requesting the event cancelation There was no argument about the two month wait after the performance. Entering the documents supporting my claim was easy.The reason for only four stars was the length of review(s).

1915,Michael Arichea,4 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"Came through in the end.  But a little confusing when first trying to file the claim.  Do I file this as a ""delay of trip"" or ""change in schedule""??  I mean...  And then sort of no communication from Allianz for weeks after filing, I had assumed (incorrectly) that they had denied my claim for some bureaucratic, minor paperwork error.   But they came through in the end.  Very glad I bought the extra travel insurance."
1916,FM,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"We had to cancel a trip a few days before departure. After submitting the necessary documents, all of our expenditures were refunded quickly."

1919,GD,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,This insurance is well worth it for traveling. We always use Alliance for all our trips. So far we've needed to use it twice and both times it covered all our expensesduring our trip experience. I'd highly recommend this insurance to anyone traveling.

1956,JS,4 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"I had an experience where days before my trip to a work seminar, the airlines put a travel advisory on the airport I was to fly through. They did not have any open flights the day of or before to get me to my destination through any airport.. I was forced to chance a canceled flight or rebook. I rebooked with another airline at double the cost of the original flight ( cheapest so close to date). The original airline credited me the money, but would not repay me. I insured the trip with Allianz and made a claim. I submitted all the proof I could. After weeks of waiting, submitting more documents ( screen shots of all the correspondences ) I was paid the difference of the new flight minus the credit. The time lapse is the reason for 4 stars versus 5."

We were able to get credits for our air but needed to cancel a non-refundable condo in theCA wine country.  Allianz reimbursed the fees that were assessed.Then a month later he needed another procedure that caused us to cancel a cruise!  Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.
1973,SC,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"that is out of my control during my scheduled travel plans. In my instance, because an airline was late and it was the last flight of the evening I was unable to make my connection. Mechanical delay is out of my control and I should've been covered, regardless of whatever the fine print said. To me, that's the very basic idea of insurance, thus the one star."
1974,RM,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,they canceled my insurance for my concert then i had to buy it again and then they couldnt refund my ticket and it took them like 20 days to get back to me so i had to resell my ticket and lost money
1975,DC,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,Website contains all the information we needed to make our decision. Website was easy to use and response time was excellent after we purchased our plans.
1976,LP,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"Thank goodness for Allianz! My husband and I had a $10,000+ cruise booked, and I broke my ankle approximately 6 weeks prior to our departure date. Unfortunately, I was unable to travel due to my injuries. Every part of our insured travel was refunded (with supporting documentation) because we chose to insure our vacay."
1977,MK,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"Straight forward processing of my claim,  very fast too ..thank you!"
1978,AM,3 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,Full reimbursement for my travel expenses were not paid for. I was only reimbursed for the partial cost of my inconvenient and re-booked flight expenses. Food expenses were also not paid for due to my travel disruptions.
1979,MT,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"Easy and pleasant to deal with.No excuses, deals with issues as promised.Love their services so much that I have referred a few people to them. Have not used any other company since I dealt with Allianz a few years back."
1980,DW,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,I chose alliance and pushed the yes button and paid for a policy. That's my only experience.
1981,JS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,We had to cancel our trip due to surgery and Allianz came through for us. We were not sure they would but they have your back.

1987,TE,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 06 2025,My experience has been awful. We requested a small amount to cover our expenses for delayed baggage (less than $150). We keep on providing documentation that they request. But they ask for more. Still no resolution. Clearly they take our payment quickly but present  obstacles.In response to a reply I received from Allianz I again provided more information. I am now waiting for their response.

1990,EH,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"It was very easy to renew our annual policy. We usually take two trips abroad and two domestic trips per year, so an annual policy meets our needs."

1993,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
1994,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"
1995,JY,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,We have purchased travel insurance with Allianz for every of our trips since Covid. The company has excellent customer service. Quick response to all our issues.

1998,MH,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"I buy Allianz Insurance for every flight I reserve for me and my family.I will no longer use them, and I will purchase insurance elsewhere‚Ä¶if any at all.I reserved a flight months in advance to get ‚Äúthe best buy‚Äù I could find for my husband and myself.  The airline changed our flight to another time which made it impossible to make an appointment that was scheduled for my husband at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. We then had to stay an extra night at the hotel, and pay for food an additional day that was not planned. I called Allianz and they assured me the extra expenses would be covered.After I emailed them all my receipts, they came back and said they would not cover the added expenses.I do believe Allianz is a Scam!! I DO NOT recommend them. I gave them one star only because I had to, so I could write a review."
1999,TB,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"Quick, responsive action in reply to our claim!!"
2000,LE,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,YOU SUCK SCAMMER DENIED MY CLAIM.  I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND YOUR COMPANY

2002,JF,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,it was very easy to sign up and any information needed was very easy to find.
2003,FR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"We purchase a year-round policy to cover potentially catastrophic events, like having to be evacuated or treated overseas.  We opt for low limits on trip cancellation or interruption, coverage fro which can be very expensive and opt instead, to self-insure. Over the years we have saved tens of thousands.  We did have one small claim for trip interruption - our return home was delayed due to a positive COVID test - and Allianz paid promptly."
2004,JG,2 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,It took to long to get the results. But overall I will use in the future.
2005,AR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,We needed to put in a claim. The process was very easy. They were available for any questions.

2009,GG,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"I am thankful to share that my Allianz experience was so extremely positive. My anticipated planned cultural trip started off excellent, but Mother Nature had a change of plans. The bayou blizzard changed my vacation plans by closing the region down, closing airports, delaying my departure, and extending my hotel stay by several days. Working with Allianz to recoup my extended hotel room stay and travel expenses was effortless. Although I would have preferred visiting the museums on my vacation to-do list, having Allianz insure my trip when it went sideways is so appreciated."
2010,SL,4 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,Very good service and easy to get.  Their recent 50% increase was hard to swallow- can get expensive now.
2011,CU,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,Easy process.  However I recommend people read everything so they know what to submit.
2012,AP,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"After an initial communication timing snafu, as well as limited statements of liability, everything worked out positively in the end.  One of the weirder parts of making a claim was providing evidence of the need for cancelation coverage - make sure that you have a reason for making your decision and evidence to back it up!"
2013,WH,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,You were clear with instructions and quick to respond.   Thank you.
2014,MM,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,Submitted claim.  Claim approved.  It's nice when a service works as expected.
2015,RH,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,Took 1 month before they partially paid for my claim. I am still fighting with them. I called and they were supposed to call me in 48hrs. It has been 3.5 days and I still have not heard from them. Terrible company. For years I bought travel insurance from them without a claim when I finally file a claim and ask them to pay $800 they refuse and are giving me a hard time. Very disappointing
2016,CA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,My experience was great with ease of navigating through the website. After reading all that was covered and how to reach customer service I was impressed.

2024,BG,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 05 2025,"There have only been a couple interactions I have had since paying for an annual and ongoing premium.  It seems like you are a company designed to collect premiums, but NOT make it easy for a policyholder to use or to even understand."

2039,KS,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 04 2025,I got insurance so I would be covered - I used the policy that was shown on the American site - come to find out you don't cover mechanical issues so we had to pay for our overnight items when we missed our connection.  This sucks - why in the world would I bother getting insurance in the future.  The claim was for less then $200 for both of us
2040,Karen,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 04 2025,"Rarely does Allianz deny a claim! They are always kind, punctual, and thorough. When a misstep occurs on a trip, and you're left having to pay for unexpected expenses, the assurance that you've got Allianz on your side is such a game breaker! This enables you to focus on taking care of the situation; when you have the time and opportunity, you can file a claim and/or speak with an agent. I so appreciate this policy, especially in light of issues which come up in air travel."

2049,GD,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 04 2025,"The best part was the ease of making the claim, the follow ups, the ability to update, and being able to talk to an agent if any questions throughout the process.  I had a very difficult claim as many things went wrong on the trip but had few issues with pushback after providing all the required documents.  The only thing I would recommend to improve is citing SPECIFIC issue that is preventing the claim from advancing."
2050,LR,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 04 2025,"I called to follow up on my claim that I have not heard back from and the representative that I spoke with made me feel like my concerns weren't valid. I even felt at times she was trying to ""check"" me with her tone and rushing of the conversation. I received very little help from her and was told to resubmit information I very well know should be already in my profile because I am meticulous in my documentation. I have yet to receive another follow up after submitting said information and at this point am second guessing the purpose of travel insurance if I have to jump through hoops to collect my losses."

2054,ED,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 04 2025,"I bought insurance just in case for an emergency. My wife's father passed away on November 24th. I got my hotel booked on December 9th because that was the cut off day for making the reservation for the wedding. Sadly, my wife never thought she would have to move in with her mother to help her with this terrible loss. I got a response that this was something that we knew would happen. I'm not sure if anyone took the time to look at my reason. The response I got seems to be computer generated; I hope that it was. I don't see how anyone could think that we knew this was going to happen."

2078,FX,2 ‚≠ê,Mar 04 2025,"I initially did not get my full amount because the reviewer did not clearly look at all my documents as I provided all my receipts correctly. I had to send a follow up email explaining in detail that some documents were misread causing me to not receive my full amount back. And even after doing so, one more receipt was missed without any explanation. It‚Äôs so much effort to get my correct amount and even though I gave very specific instructions, it was still incorrect. I guess I‚Äôm expected to constantly fix things for them and wait longer and longer for my money back. Not the best support."

I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple.

We're so happy we took out travel insurance. Allianz's website was very easy to enter a claim. It was a relief too as we had time to get all our documents together, including the doctor's letters.

My work event was cancelled because of the wild fires and the need for relief builds, which was where my event was held. After going back and forth with the man about the difference in cancelled trip policy he read off all 16 of what will be covered. One of those was your destination being affected by a natural disaster, IE  a wild fire. When stated my event was cancelled due to the wild fires there was a very long pause and then just restated the 24 hour policy that fell right after the previous destination affected by a natural disaster policy, at this point I am frustrated and clearly you are only set out to just rob people in fake insurance if you can get away with it. I‚Äôve used this insurance in the past, due to a death and even then you denied my claim and I had to sit on the phone and state my case again until you reluctant and paid on the claim. Clearly you do not care about your customers"

I wanted to be able to cancel my vacation if her family needed help or if she passed away. She did pass away. I had to cancel my trip in order to attend the celebration of life that her family planned. Allianz denied reimbursement because this was not a family member. I do believe this company is a scam and I am so disappointed in myself for purchasing it.

2136,VC,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 04 2025,Was delayed 4.5 hours and federal regulations say after 3 hours domestic travel should be reimbursed. The insurance did nothing but take my money and cover themselves. Seems on point for insurance. I booked the flights with time in mind but instead of 10pm I got home at 3am with 2 hours commute and 12 hour work day on 2 hours of sleep instead of the 7 I planned on. Frustrating getting insurance to cover these issues and be let down and exhausted. Highly doubt I will waste the money again in the future.

My experience with them was highly unsatisfactory and far from what I expected from a reputable insurance provider. Throughout the process, I found the company to be uncooperative and lacking transparency, which made resolving my claim an incredibly frustrating ordeal.Despite paying for what I believed was comprehensive trip protection, my claim was denied in a manner that felt dismissive and overly bureaucratic. The denial was delivered with a level of professionalism that, while polished, did little to address the legitimacy of my concerns or provide meaningful assistance.Ultimately, I found the entire process to be a waste of both time and money. If you are considering travel insurance for your trip, I would recommend exploring other providers with a proven track record of customer support and fair claim resolution. Allianz Partners USA, unfortunately, does not meet these standards."

In addition, I found myself frustrated when checking the status of my claim with your phone system, as it was also very sensitive to speech and not being able to use the keypad to enter the claim number and last name was inconvenient.

2329,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."

Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

Ended up getting the flu two days before I was supposed to leave and had to cancel everything. Luckily, I purchased the Allianz insurance with my concert tickets and was able to get a full refund. It was incredibly easy to file the claim and the refund was sent straight to my bank account. Missing out on my trip was bad enough, but not getting my money back for a concert I couldn't attend would have made it even worse."
2351,LK,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 02 2025,I have severe anxiety about flying right now as planes are falling from the sky and crashing in runways. Cancelling for any reason is why I purchased this insurance and felt this trip should have been covered. I‚Äôm disappointed.

2362,JR,3 ‚≠ê,Mar 02 2025,"I was under the impression that I would receive a full refund of my deposit, especially since I gave a 2 month notice of cancellation to the host of accommodations.My husband passed away, so I informed them and was told there would be no refund even with plenty of notice. He had only given 48 hours to cancel‚Ä¶I turned to Allianz and submitted death certificates, credit card receipts, and reservation documents and after a month was told my claim had been approved! To my surprise I received less than half of my deposit because we did not have our trip ‚Äúinterrupted‚Äù  while on vacation. Very misleading‚Ä¶"
2363,PS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 02 2025,"The website makes it very easy to sign up for travel insurance. More importantly, in my experience, when you have a legitimate claim and you can provide all the documentation requested, the company pays claims promptly without drama. They do not make missing your trip even worse by being difficult. They stand behind the policy they sold to you."
2364,CD,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 02 2025,"My experience is limited to only purchasing a travel insurance policy, however that was a very easy process. I answered a few questions and immediately received a quote. I have not needed to use my policy but just having it is reassuring."

2368,RH,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 02 2025,"I recently filed a claim for two separate reasons and was promptly compensated.Previously, I used them for a combined cruise and land vacation. Due to Covid related issues, our trip was booked and rebooked two additional times. Alliance transferred the insurance each time! I strongly recommend them for your vacation needs."
2369,CM,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 02 2025,We have used Allianz multiple times. This was our first claim. I will never use them again. It took Allianz 6 months to pay our claim. They repeatedly ask for information  that they had.  They asked for information that did not exist. They asked for information unrelated to our claim. The claim bounced one person to another with no apparent transfer of the status of open items. Repeated requests to escalate the claim to someone higher up were ignored.

2373,CK,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 02 2025,Reasonable prices for important travel coverage- we have used this company for years with no claims‚Ä¶ Unfortunately this year we needed to file a claim due to travel issues‚Ä¶fortunately it was easy to file the claim online with Allianz and it was processed and paid timely with no issues.
2374,HT,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 02 2025,Winter storm hit the beach area and travel was extremely dangerous wd had to cancel at last minute.

2375,CA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 02 2025,"We are so happy we took out insurance for our event.

It was a very easy process to file our claim and received our refund quick."

There were delays in each one of our connecting flights and a cancelation of one of of those connections, due to weather. We could not get to our destination in the appropriate time to attend the wedding. If we had completed the full travel plans in their original form, we would have had to turn around within a day to return, without ever being at any of the planned events. There were no guarentees from American Airlines that we would get to, or return from our destination on time. At that point, we decided to return home.Without any way to explain the circumstances in the Allianz webpage, (only documented occurrences could be submitted) we were denied any amount of the ticket price refund. Funds for food and some essentials only, were recouped."

2384,TV,3 ‚≠ê,Mar 02 2025,"On my claim, I received multiple correspondence indicating my claim review was completed and receiving a payment amount for a fractional of the total only to receive a follow-up indicating the payment was a partial payment.

2385,KT,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 02 2025,When I buy tickets to a concert I always get insurance with Allianz. They are the best in service. I rarely have to turn in a claim but when I do they are very quick to respond and refund my money. Great customer service.I highly recommend!!

2387,AN,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 02 2025,"I requested a refund for personal reasons and it was the most intrusive and dehumanizing experience I've ever been through. I still don't understand why a concert ticket refund requires more documentation than any federal paperwork or taxes. I usually don't go out of my way to write reviews either but this was truly a terrible experience. If you book a ticket - make sure to go or transfer it even if you've broken a bone, because it seems you have to be in the hospital to get a refund."

I have gotten online and seen that it switched to needing more documentation and then it lists out the ones that it needs, but the thing is is that I already submitted the documentation that they are Saying that they need. Twice now when I have seen that on the status update on the app I have called and talked to representative, I‚Äôve gotten two different callbacks from my examiner, and I explain that what I just said, and they check into it and assure me that there‚Äôs nothing else that I need to do That they are in the final stages of processing it and to watch out for the email. The promise that is made that they give 10 to 14 business days to process the documentation submitted. My claim has has the documentation submitted for almost an entire month now. The guy that I talk to yesterday assured me that just wait 24 hours and that the examiner‚Äôs office was aware and were processing the claim as we spoke. Well, I am here 24 hours later and no email of course. Beyond frustrating if there‚Äôs no other documentation that‚Äôs needed Then why does it take 30 days to  Process documents?"

2446,DF,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 01 2025,"The weather was bad.  United Airlines strongly encouraged me to cancel my seat, they did it for free.I didn't know they were not cancelling the flight which is what Alianz wanted to see in order to pay for my hotel which I did not use.I normally don't purchase insurance but this trip was iffy.  Allianz convinced me to continue to not purchase the insurance."

I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple.

I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
2450,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

2453,KG,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 01 2025,"I purchased the insurance before a 12 day cruise. The process was very easy and efficient online.

2471,JM,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 01 2025,I only bought the insurance because it said you could be reimbursed for many things.  I purchased it in case I couldn‚Äôt use the ticket because of a school conflict.  Found out concert I bought tickets for was at the same time as a school externship.  Supplied the proof of externship and it was denied!  What a joke and a waste of $260.  DO NOT SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY ON INSURANCE!  They find a way to get around covering your purchase.
2472,AR,1 ‚≠ê,Mar 01 2025,Issue was never resolved.

I had to pay out of pocket for a ct scan but was promptly reimbursed when I got home. I would definitely recommend this company for your travel insurance needs. Thank you Allianz!
2483,CM,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 28 2025,They followed
2484,RK,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 28 2025,I have been attempting to get a claim satisfied and all I keep getting g is emails asking to submit details. This I  have done several times but to no avail.It would be so much better being handled on a person to lesson basis instead of IT systems in the middle
2485,BJ,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 28 2025,I would never get insurance with you again. Ripoff

2488,PA,4 ‚≠ê,Feb 28 2025,"The UI is easily navigated on web and app. Customer Support is great! I would have provided five stars, but I feel the final decision on my baggage delay claim should have been approved. I provided the claim file and the date the airline located my bag 2+ days later. I was without my bag, not knowing if it was going to be found for two days. Regardless of that, I'd use Allianz again for travel insurance. They are easy to work with. Thank you."
2489,KG,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 28 2025,"Only one traveler received an approved claim reimbursement check when 2 people were listed on the policy and both claims were approved. When the wronged claimant contacted Allianz she was told only 1 person per policy would be compensated INCORRECT.  Once a corporate representative was  contacted, she was told that both claimants should be compensated and a check would be sent.  The check was received, but it should not have taken so many calls and time to resolve the problem.  It appears that front line call center rep. has not been properly trained or do not know who to contact internally to properly resolve  a claim. Very poor and unprofessional customer service."
2490,BA,2 ‚≠ê,Feb 28 2025,"Very dissatisfied that you did not honor our claim.  Next time we look for travel insurance, we will look at a different company.Would have given you a one star except that it was easy to file a claim and response was prompt.Of course it doesn't take much to say ""No."""

2493,RJ,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 28 2025,"We have told you and told you, all we want is our $$ back on the condo we only got to spend one night in!!! We have sent the invoice for that.

2494,SK,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 28 2025,Allianz listened to my situation and helped make it better.
2495,DB,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 28 2025,Got this insurance as my wife wasn't sure if she would have to go on a company trip or not and we wanted to be able to get a refund.  She was not able to go and the insurance claim was refused.  Basically we learned to go through Delta itself instead of this waste of time.  Never getting flight insurance again.
2496,PM,4 ‚≠ê,Feb 28 2025,"I appreciate the coverage, cost, efficiency of application and prompt receipt of the document.  I've not needed to apply for reimbursement so can't comment ( although isn't it the saying when you need it you don't have it so....). The explanation of benefits is so long, a concise coverage explanation, does/doesn't would be appreciated"

2506,Craig Larson,2 ‚≠ê,Feb 28 2025,The claims process is cumbersome and slow.  They take up to 14 business days to review your claim.  What they don't tell you is that they will keep asking for additional documentation one piece at a time and take 14 business days to examine your file after each document is submitted. It has been 2 months for my claim now and it is still not resolved
2507,DH,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 28 2025,Refund processing was easy

2542,JG,4 ‚≠ê,Feb 28 2025,"Ultimately, I was very happy to receive full refund of everything I was owed. I found the process tedious in that I did not understand all the documentation that was required of me.I called numerous times. Everyone I spoke with was very kind and helpful; however, they gave me only the one piece of information that I thought I needed and once, how to submit it.I would then be notified that I needed to submit something else. I would obtain that piece of documentation: only to be notified again that something else was needed. This happened numerous times. Of course, often weeks would go by between correspondence.It would have been MOST beneficial if I would have been given a list of *everything* I needed to submit all at once with instructions of how to submit this information.Initially I was told I needed to ‚Äúscan and create a pdf file.‚Äù I do not have a printer or scanner and do not know how to create a pdf file. This caused serious angst on my part for many weeks!!! Much to my relief, I was eventually told I could take a screenshot of these documents and email them. And I could also just forward the emails I received from the airline. What a relief!!!Eventually, everything was completed and submitted and I received full refund. I do want to acknowledge that every person at Allianz that I spoke with was very kind and patient and helpful with their one piece of information they gave me. They all asked if there was anything else they could help me with. I never knew that there was more‚Ä¶and more‚Ä¶and more.And, I would definitely keep using Allianz!"

I filed a claim this company said they won‚Äôt cover trip cancelled by airline, wow! Who would have cancelled a trip if  it the carrier? This company would be reported to BBB. Delta airlines didn‚Äôt know the activities of this company, and they prey on unsuspecting passengers."

I‚Äôve traveled extensively and faced a few unexpected hurdles, but having Allianz as a safety net has made those situations much less stressful."
2679,DP,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 26 2025,"Purchasing travel insurance gave me peace of mind.  When we missed our first day, night and had such a headache for disruption- I was comforted that we wouldn't have to pay for our missed night in the hotel and the plans we had missed.  Yet, we were only covered for ""lost luggage"" for $300 after much submissions.  Not worth my time to get all of the receipts and forms and claims and notes from the travel agency and the airline submitted."

2685,OS,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 26 2025,"Allianz handled my claim quickly and accurately. As soon as my flight delay was confirmed, they reimbursed me for the maximum amount due‚Äîsurprisingly, even more than my submitted receipts. The process was smooth, and the coverage was well worth the investment. In today's unpredictable travel landscape, having Allianz is a necessity. Highly recommended!"

2688,AK,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 26 2025,"Our return flight, purchased months in advance, was cancelled due to weather and the next flight was 4 days later.  We were told that our flight insurance covered our flight cancellation due to inclement weather.  We read our policy and it stated, ""Inclement Weather causing cancellation or delay of the Insured‚Äôs Trip for at least 12 consecutive hours."" is covered.  We were told that our claim had been approved and we should get a check in 3-5 business days.  Two weeks later, when we called back because we had not received payment, we were told that our claim had been denied.  Online it stated that we should receive an email or letter with the reasons we had been denied.  It's been almost 2 months and no response.  You may burn me once but never again.  This company is a total scam."
2689,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
2690,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"
2691,JY,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,We have purchased travel insurance with Allianz for every of our trips since Covid. The company has excellent customer service. Quick response to all our issues.

2695,TD,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 26 2025,"Had a baggage delay issue spanning 13 days. I spent hours on the phone just to get someone with the airline to locate and deliver them to us. Allianz reps Insisted on documents I didn‚Äôt have and couldn‚Äôt obtain. Could prove delay with FedEx date stamped delivery ticket, but that wasn‚Äôt acceptable documentation. Worthless coverage and reps not willing to work with me to find a resolution. Shitty coverage, worthless reps! Will never use again."
2696,LJ,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 26 2025,The pricing and what the annual travel insurance covers is what attracted me to Allianz travel insurance. I purchased it online and it was easy and intuitive.

2699,K&,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 26 2025,We had some questions and never had an issue reaching a knowledgeable person in customer service to answer questions and walk us through the process. We won‚Äôt hesitate to use Allianz again to insure us on our next trip. Life can be unpredictable and things can happen fast so we feel it‚Äôs important to be covered in case something unfortunate happens.

2703,TA,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 26 2025,Having a 5hr travel day turn into a 16+hr day was not in the cards and the airline did nothing to help with accommodations beside send an apology email. Thank you for your quick response and reimbursements. I've had insurance over 4yrs now and it's definitely worth it in times like these.
2704,JB,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 26 2025,The ease of filing a claim and the speed of payment process was incredible.
2705,DK,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 26 2025,"Luggage was destroyed going to Sydney Australia from Michigan, USA, presently on a World Cruise and insurance did not cover because of the delay in responding to Delta Airlines - I replaced bag out of my own funds with no help from Allianz.  Would think twice why I purchase insurance for travel."
2706,GZ,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 26 2025,BEWARE OF THE COMPANY OVER CHARGING YOUR CREDIT CARD.Purchased an AA ticket and opted for the recommended insurance policy through Allianz. The amount was to be $360. Came to find out my credit card was charged for over $760 instead. Cancelled the policy after 3 days but was only credited back for the $360 and when I called them they kept denying the over charge. Finally had to call AMEX and confirm the charges for $760 and dispute the charges in order to get fully refunded for the amount through my CC company.
2707,CA,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 26 2025,"Waste of money. Ligit Claim rejected and no place to fully explain the situation. Regret buying this insurance, wont ever make that mistake again. Horrible experience. Zero stars. Telling everyone I know not to invest in trip ins @ALLIANZ, esp when it won't pay a claim. Very disappointed. It all happened the exact day I was covered and they wont cover any of my claim."

It is expensive to use but it does give you the feeling of comfort.  I buy it for the Medical Insurance and not for the other items listed.

2795,BS,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 25 2025,"I‚Äôm the person who NEVER buys insurance, and I don‚Äôt even remember purchasing it this time but for some reason I must have. When my father passed away unexpectedly I wasn‚Äôt in the right headspace and forgot to try to sell our tickets to an events we couldn‚Äôt attend. I realized after that I had insurance on them and they refunded me the money within 24 hours of my claim. The process was so easy, which was a huge relief given the stressful situation we were dealing with. Will definitely use Allianz insurance again."
2796,A.,4 ‚≠ê,Feb 25 2025,Per the phone conversation while reporting my incident the representative was very attentive and helpful
2797,CF,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 25 2025,I paid for a flight and was not allowed to board due to new rules to travel to Uk which was not advised to be until day of flight . I paid for insurance incase anything went wrong and I figured cancel flight was on your insurance policy and according to you guys you don't cover that. What good is your insurance for if all you guys do is find excuses to deny claims.very unsatisfied and from now on I will no longer pay for insurance in the future because if something as small as a cancel flight can't be insured and refunded I could only imagine the headache it would be if something went wrong to get help from you guys . I'll rather deal with it on my own .

2799,EK,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 25 2025,Safe reliable travel insurance is very necessary
2800,JD,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 25 2025,They wouldn't give me my money back on My tickets because they said the reason was not covered but did not provide reasons upfront when insurance was offered... I'm very unhappy with this company and it did nothing to help me and I lost 500.00 worth of ticket money over it. I wouldn't suggest them to anyone for any reason. They're a scam... they will rob you of your money and make you pay extra for it even then not cover you anyways... disgusting.
2801,JM,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 25 2025,"Since we did not use your policy, my comments are directed to the ease with which we were able to acquire it. One thing that I could not identify was: Buying medical insurance alone. How do I do that?"

I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple.

I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
2810,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy.

2828,SK,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 24 2025,"It is reasonably priced for annual coverage. Not having had to make a claim yet, I may have a different opinion if they start to nickle and dime me with denied coverage. However, going through the policy it appears that the coverage is quite extensive, hopefully if and when I would need to make a claim it is covered"
2829,BS,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 24 2025,You are a sham.  Collect premiums and use legalese to deny any claim‚Ä¶‚Ä¶never again.

2832,YV,2 ‚≠ê,Feb 24 2025,"We lost two days at an expensive prepaid resort.  We learned after the fact that we needed to lose at least half of our stay or more to be eligible for compensation from that stay.  And the burden of proof was on us to show the plane had mechanical issues causing the missed flight two days in a row.  Our baggage had been sent to our destination ahead of us.  Again, we were asked to prove that.  It was an unfortunate experience.  We will do research on other insurance providers going forward.  Disappointing."

2839,FA,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 24 2025,"i feel like we were totally fooled by this policy.  We were delayed and could not use a prebooked hotel night.  we were told that the only $200 per person was covered even though we had to get a hotel room, etc. because of the missed connection and then we lost the pre-booked hotel room which had cost us approximately $850."

Will not be purchasing this insurance ever again, complete waste of time and money and horrible customer service."

Will be getting my insurance from another source for future travels.UPDATE: After contacting Allianz numerous times, my final call was to ask for a refund of the cost of insurance since it provided no benefit. Out of the blue a check arrived in the mail for more than I paid for the insurance. Called Allianz, they informed me that was my benefit. Case closed. Adding one star."

The airline didn‚Äôt cancel, but they delayed a flight twice causing (due to weather conditions) the flight to arrive the next day! You all lied and told me nothing was wrong with the weather, which was not true. Every other reservation I made refunded me. I should‚Äôve been honored my money back. False advertisement!"

There were some ambiguities on what documents were required so I did the best I could.  The company kept me informed of the status throughout the claims process and my claim was settled well within their 7-14 business day estimate.  Pricing for this insurance was very reasonable and I expect that I'll be adding this coverage to upcoming travels.
2948,Julia Kreck,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 22 2025,Submitting a claim via the website was simple and straight forward. Being able to track the progress of the claim through your system was appreciated and receiving the payment so quickly after the determination was made was impressive.  I really appreciated all of this as I have been grieving the loss of my partner of 17 years and it has been a very difficult time.
2949,B-,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 22 2025,Terrible decision to buy this insurance. My flight was delayed for 24hours to a prepaid all inclusive in Mexico.  I lost $749/night as a result. Allianz did not pay for it.  Total waste of money to buy this insurance.

2959,RK,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 22 2025,It is not ok to charge someone for insurance. But then not refund them when they need it and make a claim.
2960,SH,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 22 2025,Bought the insurance before we left for our trip ended up in the ICU and had to cancel the trip. Submitted all the documents the company needed including all the documents from every doctor reason for being at the hospital including the dates all the doctor notes and the entire claim was denied. Lost out on all the money spent for the trip including spending over 200 dollars on the insurance reasons out of my control being in the hospital and they still denied it. I would recommend that no one ever uses this company because no matter the situation or circumstances it will be denied.

2974,JC,2 ‚≠ê,Feb 22 2025,"Disappointed, you requested additional documents which I needed to get from the tour operator who was not back in the country yet and the day after requesting them you sent out a check for just over $2000.  Then t set up a call with the actual claims examiner at 8 am on 2/18 which never occurred .  He called back at a different time and left a message.  Additionally, he did not properly review the the airplane ticket costs/rebate fee.  and I was only given a partial refund for them. I am still owed an additional 750. For the air tix .  Finally, I have one more document to provide which is the contract which I have just gotten a copy of from the tour operator which will require you to reimburse me over 3k more.  There are other fees for which I was not compensated for either: ie. $214. ($107.x2) for the cost of obtaining 2 Ghanaian visas. I was reimbursed the cost to send the visa applications and the return fed ex fee for the visas.  But not the cost of the visas themselves.  What‚Äôs wrong with you people???  I paid over 1200 bucks for this policy and this has not been a seamless experience by any means.  I need my money back ASAP or I am going to the state insurance board."
2975,CS,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 22 2025,"It‚Äôs such a relief having a policy with Allianz. It gives us peace of mind to plan our travels. When we‚Äôve had trip interruptions, Allianz quickly assists us with reimbursements."

This company does not use people in the United States for their customer service. Unfortunately the people I spoke to were very hard to understand and they also seemed to struggle to understand me.

3067,JG,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 21 2025,The best insurance is the one one does not need to use and which permits one to sleep easily at night. The real proof of its value is if an expensive event happens on a trip and one needs to use the insurance. If that happens then the insurance can be fully evaluated. Till then any response has to do with one's quality of sleep. I've used Allianz several time over the years and have no regrets regardless of the cost.

I purchased travel insurance, which cost over $80, after realizing my brother couldn‚Äôt make the trip to GSP from COS. The insurance I bought promised me that it would be refunded if I filed a claim. I filed a claim, and sent the proper information needed. Since then, I have not received my money back.

3091,DF,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 21 2025,"They made a stressful experience easier by being clear on what they needed for submission to insurance without feeling like they were trying to find a reason to deny us, which has been our experience with the airline that we are dealing with regarding the same trip which cost us a lot of time and energy due to their delays and cancellations. We have been trying to get some minimal reimbursement after our luggage being delayed for over 4 days and we wish they would deal with our situation in the same professional manner that Allianz did."

3155,GA,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 20 2025,Handling a claim has been extremely cumbersome.  I continue to receive requests for information I have already provided.  All is done electronically.  I have not been given a chance to speak to an individual regarding my claim.
3156,KA,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 20 2025,Easy to purchase and file claim.
3157,CB,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 20 2025,Claim filing was super easy. Loved the quick response after claim was filed as well as how quickly my medical expenses were reimbursed!
3158,SG,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 20 2025,"Bought insurance in the event of a delay or cancellation. Total failure and a rip-off. Flight was delayed massively including being stuck on the aircraft for 7 hours, of which only 3 hours was in flight. Denied refund or compensation. Scam."
3159,CA,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 20 2025,The insurance I purchased did not cover a weather emergency postponement
3160,CU,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 20 2025,So I had a fall at home just hours before my flight and needed to go to emergency room for facial cut requiring stitches. Missed my flight and had non-refundable tickets. Submitted claim next morning which was a Sunday and had refund of ticket cost in my checking account that evening. Now that's fast! I recommend Allianz Partners highly for that extra peace of mind when flying.

3167,DR,3 ‚≠ê,Feb 20 2025,"the claim process was not very transparent. I did receive a payment for my claim but it was less than what I claimed and there was no explanation of which  expenses were reimbursed and which were not and no reasons were provided for why some expenses were not covered. Otherwise, the claim process was fairly simple, but it did take a month before it was complete."
3168,GQ,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 20 2025,Associates were very helpful. I had a minor bump up on my last business trip and the claim was taken care expeditiously. I would thoroughly recommend Allianz to all business and leisure travelers.

It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
3170,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

After submission of my receipts, I was told it would take 5-7 business days. After that time I received an email saying they wanted my e itinerary of the trip, which took another 7 days to process. Once it was finally approved, it took 10 business days to clear.

3182,SG,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 20 2025,Friendly assistance in making claim and best of all claim paid Thank you!!!!!No one should travel or buy show or concert tickets for a future date without this insurance.

3183,MK,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 20 2025,Service was prompt.  Everyone we spoke to was helpful.  The claim was quickly resolved to our satisfaction.
3184,SA,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 20 2025,You say you are an award winning  company yet you have strict guidelines on how to refund a ticket..a family member died in a recent air plane crash ..closer to me then a family member and you refuse to refund ticket because they are not blood...I could not fly after the accident and asked to be refunded..AND YOU PUT MONEY OVER GRIEF AND SAID NO...each case should be reviewed under its only circumstances and not thrown into a general pile of reasons..I wish I could give you a zero..

3214,JB,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 20 2025,Do NOT buy this insurance for Ticketmaster concert tickets. There are so many caveats that you will never get reimbursed.  I had a wedding come up on the day of the concert and they wiggled their way out of reimbursing me because they said the wedding was not  more than 100 miles away. Did not find that anywhere in the contract. Buyer beware.
3215,A&,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 20 2025,"When calling in, the staff taking our calls were always knowledgeable, helpful, patient, and courteous.

Honestly, I would have been better off not spending the money at all. On top of that, you don't even follow your own claim guidelines, and there‚Äôs no way to speak with a real person."

3278,LT,2 ‚≠ê,Feb 19 2025,"I recently had to reschedule a flight due to a winter storm impeding my destination city. The insurance website says that you can receive a set amount without a receipt. I've still haven't received a claim approval even with screen-shots of my new flight plan, the email stating that a snow storming was affecting my destination city, and the fact that the storm was broadcasted on the national news. I've had baggage delayed in the past in which the airline had to deliver it to my home. Even with the baggage not arriving with my flight I was never reimbursed."

3329,CH,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 19 2025,"We enjoy cruising especially during the winter and once we figured out we needed real insurance when things go wrong.  All cruise lines require partial payment when you book a cruise and most lines require your cruise be paid in full before departure.  It is the peace of mind knowing we have real insurance if something doesn‚Äôt go as planned.  Our only claim (4/2017) was for a 7 day cruise we had paid in full and my wife was diagnosed with cancer 3 weeks before our cruise and the doctor said she needed to start treatment asap.  Allianz got all of our cruise cost returned.  Also on a trip to the Middle East a friend had a fall and broke his leg.  He was treated at a first class hospital and all his expenses were covered by Allianz.  Now that we are retired and still like to travel, we know we must have ‚Äúreal‚Äù insurance.  Other things can go wrong, so you need to check out what all they cover.  It‚Äôs worth it to have piece of mind!"

I was notified that it was approved. My refund was in my bank account within a couple of days. The surprise was, I received the entire amount.     Since one never knows what will come up, this service is a win-win."

Despite the health situation, I was pleasantly surprised when the insurance was accepted. Simple, practical and very honest."
3334,LR,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 19 2025,"I paid for the insurance and it would not cover a grave mistake I made.

(not our fault) We were delayed and missed our flight (Not the airlines fault) and we had to pay $2300 for a change fee.  We were almost certain that a delay such as this (RCL Cruises fault) would be covered by our Trip Delay Insurance as part of our Allianz policy.  But, lo and behold, it was not. They said, ""‚Ä¢	Your insurance program provided Trip Interruption benefits for very specific reasons. Unfortunately, the medical issue of another passenger causing the delay in travel is not included among those reasons."" Well what the hell DOES it cover then?? So not only did I purchase trip insurance & pay for a flight change, but you kick my ass by not actually having Trip Delay coverage with a Trip Delay policy.  Well played!"
3352,SW,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 19 2025,The process fairly automated but talking to a person can help.  Facts without and explanation can be difficult is the process does not allow for open dialogue!

So now I‚Äôm out money because I thought cancel for any reason at all, really meant any reason at all. Don‚Äôt buy this insurance."

3514,MC,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 18 2025,N/A
3515,RH,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 18 2025,Allianz listened to my query and responded appropriately.  Very happy with the response.
3516,CC,4 ‚≠ê,Feb 18 2025,Being able to have our money for the canceled trip returned within 30 days was appreciated.  We feel terrible that we had to cancel and missed our trip but glad we bought the insurance and it came through.
3517,DO,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 18 2025,"The plan was adequately described, no problems subscribing."
3518,Steve McDowell,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 18 2025,"Your insurance is terrible. When a Hurricane wipes out the place where your staying and you have to cancel your plans,  and the insurance doesn't cover that. That's terrible."

3520,JA,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 18 2025,"I wish I would have read the reviews on this company beforehand.I bought a rather pricey concert ticket, and seen that I could purchase insurance that is ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to cover the price of said ticket and refund you the price in case something would happen. Well, about a week later, I ended up having a home catastrophe, in which I will need all the money I could muster up to fix the disaster it left behind. As much as I hated to do it, cause I really wanted to go to the concert, I decided to put in a claim with the insurance I bought so I could get my money back. I submitted my claim with a description of what happened and a receipt of the purchase price of ticket. They have several scenarios that you could pick from but none of them matched my situation and they wanted proof, as in some kind of document. I told them I wouldn‚Äôt be able to give them any such proof until around the end of August (that‚Äôs when all the work would be done by) and the concert was in May. I didn‚Äôt hear from them for around two weeks, then I decided to go on their website to see if there was any kind of update. That‚Äôs when it said my claim was denied and they were going to send me an email or letter saying so. Two weeks went by, no email or letter, then finally I got a letter.They made absolutely NO EFFORT to try and find out more information by phone call or email.Read the reviews on this company before you make your decision on using this so called insurance company. Now I understand the reason for the MANY bad reviews."
3521,AN,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 18 2025,Simple and easy and money was all returned quickly.
3522,DK,2 ‚≠ê,Feb 18 2025,"Too much to state, to summarize I started  my claim on 11-28-2014 and finally got last payment on 2-15-24 (2 1/2 months plus).  I talked to people who said examiner would call back and didn't get responses.  I sent many emails but responses were not informative.  During phone calls the computer voice (AI) said to see the website for current update.  The website said my trip interruption claim was closed on 12-4-24 due to no information received yet below that it listed the 8 files I had uploaded.  That closed update did not change, despite emails, until 1/24/2025.  I submitted airline tickets and hotel fees totaling $7292.16 in my trip interruption claim and received a check for $2768.70 with no information as to how that was determined.  Understand, this may be the proper amount I just have no idea of how they reached this amount.  They did process my medical claim and I understood why I got what I got but it took 2 months to finalize."
3523,ND,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 18 2025,We were delayed and made a small claim. It went through quickly and filing was straightforward.

3529,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
3530,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"
3531,JY,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,We have purchased travel insurance with Allianz for every of our trips since Covid. The company has excellent customer service. Quick response to all our issues.

3532,DA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,My husband had unexpected open heart surgery that caused us to cancel a trip to see family in December.  We were able to get credits for our air but needed to cancel a non-refundable condo in theCA wine country.  Allianz reimbursed the fees that were assessed.Then a month later he needed another procedure that caused us to cancel a cruise!  Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.
3533,SB,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 18 2025,"Duped into purchasing insurance when purchasing concert tickets. I‚Äôd give ZERO stars if I could. Unable to select level of insurance and just given a price attached along with all of the other fees at the time of purchase.  Very very deceiving. This is a racket and the Allianz is making bank off innocent people spending good money to have a good time.Ultimately it is up Allianz and their ‚Äúguidelines‚Äù to approve of your claim and of course my claim was denied because ‚Äúyou knew at the time of purchasing your tickets that you could attend your event‚Äù. Well if I could predict the future  I sure wouldn‚Äôt have purchased this  scam of insurance and I would have known my husband was having this unexpected surgery‚Ä¶ you know, it‚Äôs called things happen in life that aren‚Äôt expected.I had to submit all of my husband‚Äôs personal medical documents to this company to prove what has happened and what will happen  and now in of that information is out there. TOTAL SCAM!! I will now think twice about purchasing anything that has Allianz company attached.Good luck"
3534,JS,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 18 2025,Always purchased but never had to use until now. The process was easy and I got a decision within two weeks. I‚Äôll be continuing adding on their plans for the peace of mind of knowing they have me covered.
3535,HR,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 18 2025,The whole process was far more simple than I thought it was going to be.  Send all your claims information and receipts  online with an explanation of events.The agent that I spoke to was super helpful too.

3540,KS,3 ‚≠ê,Feb 18 2025,"Of the two claims I have made for delayed baggage and a weather delay that required a hotel stay, Allianz reimbursed me about .50 per dollar spent.

3560,MH,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 17 2025,"Trying to get home after our cruise all flights home got canceled due to a snow storm. I had to rebook a different day, with a different company, leaving my husband and sister behind for 2 more days because there was only 1 seat and I had to get home for my animals. We ended dishing out way more money due to the original cancelation. We got reimbursed for just about everything. I am extremely grateful, thankful, and impressed with how easy it is to use their online site to file a claim. I definitely recommend getting insurance and I will again."

3564,AH,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 17 2025,"I purchased a travel protection package, but I made a mistake when entering the travel date and year. I mistakenly entered the travel period of 12/23/2025 to 1/6/2026. The travel date I entered is almost 10 months away, and I have no intention of traveling during that time to the destination.I contacted their customer service agent, who advised me to email them at the provided address. I sent an email explaining the error and requesting a trip cancellation. However, they responded by asking me to submit a copy of a trip cancellation letterhead from the agency where I purchased the ticket. I clearly stated in my email that I had entered the incorrect date, so there was no need for a cancellation.Despite my explanation, it has been over two months since I sent my email, and I have yet to receive a response. Their customer service has been completely ignoring all of my messages. This experience has been extremely frustrating for a first-time customer like me. It is clear that they are not a reputable company and are not willing to provide any assistance.I strongly advise anyone considering purchasing travel protection to look elsewhere. If you want to avoid the hassle and headache of dealing with such a poor customer service experience, I recommend seeking out a different company."
3565,KV,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 17 2025,"The website to file a claim is very user friendly.  The contact was timely to what was still needed. I even had to email and clarify what was needed, and received the response timely and was very informative. Process was explained very simply.  Even when a second claim had to be made, it was explained why and how."
3566,CL,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 17 2025,Ease of filing a claim and prompt processing.
3567,RG,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 17 2025,"I could not be more pleased with the claims process and resolution that I experienced through Allianz.  The requested documentation was easy to download on to their claims site and the processing time from submission to final review was extremely fast.  In the end, I received fair compensation and would highly recommend this company.  Several travel agents had recommended Allianz in the past for the reasons I've mentioned and now I've had a personal experience to back them up!  All in all, the most seamless process ever!  They were an absolute pleasure to deal with."
3568,AF,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 17 2025,"We bought the insurance on our flight for the second time and on the second time a flight was cancelled, leaving us stranded in another country. The Hotel would not cancel the room in the US, since we were delayed a day. Allianz came through and covered almost all of our expenses for the new room and meals. It was a simple form and process!"
3569,LA,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 17 2025,I still have not received a award for insurance coverage. They have delayed and delayed and ....I am very disappointed.
3570,JD,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 17 2025,Absolutely terrible service. Zero coverage.

3572,JF,4 ‚≠ê,Feb 17 2025,"The great part is you processed my claim fairly and paid out in a quick time frame.  The bad part is instructions on what documentation you needed and where to get it was not at all clear and required a call to your customer support.  Also the limits of coverage due to a trip interruption was not clearly stated and I still don't understand if my claim exceeded the limits for one day only or if my interruption had lasted more than one day, if my limit for the total amount of claim reimbursement had already been exceeded."
3573,MG,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 17 2025,"I recommend this company, I had no issues with my reimbursement"

My cruise was canceled by the cruiseline because they were pulling the ship out of service as a last minute decision. Allianz denied my claim saying ship maintenance was not a covered reason. Bogus and disheartening. Will not be purchasing again. Definitely seek alternative more inclusive insurance
3589,GK,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 17 2025,"Never know what could happen and in our case, one of three concert ticket holders got the flu. Was very easy to make a claim and recoup most if expense except the $4.95 Ticketmaster processing fee."

3591,WB,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 17 2025,What is the point really? You might as well not have insurance and just let the airline credit you. This process took entirely too long to get them to review and then decline. We bought my daughter a ticket prior to her accepting a spot in a medical training program that doesn‚Äôt allow absences. That doesn‚Äôt count as ‚Äúwork‚Äù despite her being in class or studying 18 hours a day 4 days a week. So I give up. We won‚Äôt purchase this again from them and don‚Äôt advise anyone else to or good luck if you do.

3593,RW,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 17 2025,"We were devastated when we thought we lost all that money, but Allianz was great to work with, very helpful and prompt.  I would recommend them to protect your investment of what is sometimes very pricey tickets."

3668,Michael Brett,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 17 2025,"I purchased Allianz travel insurance 4 months before a fishing trip to Sitka Alaska. 2 weeks before this trip I tore several ligaments in my right knee (complete ACL tear, partial MCL tear and two meniscus tears). I was on crutches for 2 months afterwards and was not able to get around on uneven surfaces. There was no way I could get around in remote areas in Alaska with this injury. I submitted a claim to Allianz because I lost out on a deposit I put down on a boat rental, as well as for a water taxis shuttle and a day of guided fishing which altogether totaled about $1,000. Allianz rapidly paid only part of my claim (only $250) because they said my knee injury was a ""pre-existing"" condition. I was very disappointed in this and felt I was ripped up. My injury occurred 3 and 1/2 months AFTER I purchased travel insurance, so how in the world is this a pre-existing condition! I ended up losing $750 on this trip. I can easily understand what insurance companies have such a terrible reputation. I read Allianz advertising after this trip and I feel their advertising is VERY MISLEADING! signed Mike Brett"
3669,Susan Heine Borgnini,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 17 2025,"The trip Allianz planned for us through AAA, included an intercity train trip and transfer to the Euro train to London.  Upon our arrival to board the Euro Train, Allianz had not planned in enough time to make the transfer, therefore we did not make our connection with the private driver Allianz scheduled to meet us in London.  Allianz has refused to refund over $200.00 that we were charged for the driver, even though the missed ride was due to Allianz error in scheduling.  We have sent a written a request to Allianz regarding this and were told we should take it up with our travel insurance. This was Allianz‚Äô error in scheduling an arrival and departure too close."
3670,CB,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 17 2025,"Recently I got sick while visiting Panama.

The claim was handled quickly and efficiently. The only problem was a taxi ride back to the airport where the driver would only take cash. I even took the bags out of the cab not realizing it was ALL cabs in the Mexican town. So then I had the driver sign his name, the taxi company name, his cab number, the amount in pesos, and the amount paid in US $s. It was $25 but sadly Allianz denied it.

Not impressed and will look for different travel insurance in the future.Edit: after the condescending reply from their ‚Äúso-called‚Äù customer service, I will just throw out 3 other companies that I have used and are far, far better choices: Travelex is better, AIG is better and 7 corners is also far better. Purchasing travel coverage through Allyz is easy and convenient because it‚Äôs usually right there when you book your travel, but that in no way makes it a better choice. Choose wisely."
3737,EK,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 16 2025,My refund for my tickets was issued promptly and without any major effort on my part beyond some light paperwork.  I appreciate that I had the piece of mind that my tickets would be refunded while dealing with a medical emergency in my home.
3738,Bayla Berkowitz,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 16 2025,N/A
3739,NW,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 16 2025,"Truly terrible. I paid for this service, my flight before the one I needed to cancel was delayed by 6 hours, couldn‚Äôt reschedule my flight because of timing, and this company, with proof of delays that would make my trip impossible, denies the claim. Guess that algorithm to automatically deny claims isn‚Äôt just in health insurance. Don‚Äôt give these people your money."
3740,LL,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 16 2025,Prompt positive response.  Very good job
3741,LN,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 16 2025,Love it. Refund process is easy. I uploaded all documents and I received refund in 2 weeks
3742,JD,2 ‚≠ê,Feb 16 2025,I paid for the insurance to cover my ticket purchase.  Only 1/3 or less of the total cost was covered.  Did not cover my wife's ticket even though I purchased them all together and paid for the ticket insurance when it came up.  I had to use the insurance because of the loss of my job and not not traveling for the trade show.
3743,JC,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 16 2025,"My experience was fantastic.needed to make a claim and they couldn‚Äôt be more helpful.walked me through the process and made it very easy.unfortunately I don‚Äôt have a specific name or names, all people involved were friendly and professional.thank you very much Allainz"

3745,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
3746,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"
3747,JY,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,We have purchased travel insurance with Allianz for every of our trips since Covid. The company has excellent customer service. Quick response to all our issues. It is a great peace of mind when we travel around the world knowing that Allianz will always be there to assist us.
3748,DA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,My husband had unexpected open heart surgery that caused us to cancel a trip to see family in December.  We were able to get credits for our air but needed to cancel a non-refundable condo in theCA wine country.  Allianz reimbursed the fees that were assessed.Then a month later he needed another procedure that caused us to cancel a cruise!  Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.
3749,KA,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 16 2025,Super easy to make the claim. The payment was approved within hours and paid out within days.
3750,PB,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 16 2025,It was awful. My trip to Las Angelos was cancelled by my work due to the wildfires and yall wanted me to provide documentation from the fire department of LA and FEMA. Unreal. I think they have better things to do than to send me documentation for that when it‚Äôs known across the us.
3751,JF,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 16 2025,"This travel insurance company really surprised me with their dependable and consistent communication as to the status of our claim.  Once the claim was initiated they kept us informed of our status in the process.  Was pleasantly surprised, thought I would have to keep sending them something.  My only problem was figuring out how to download information requested."
3752,AK,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 16 2025,There are a number of insurance options based on how much you travel and all are clearly described. We found one that suits are needs well and includes all travel both domestic and foreign.
3753,GM,4 ‚≠ê,Feb 16 2025,"Coverage meets our needs at a reasonable cost for annual plan.  We vacation several times a year, often cruising, and need medical coverage as Medicare does not cover out of the US.  Only reason I did not give Allianz 5 stars is a prior claim for a cancelled flight was not covered because it was a ""mechanical issue"", which made no sense to me.  However, everyone raves about Allianz so giving it another try."
3754,SS,4 ‚≠ê,Feb 16 2025,great customer service
3755,AP,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 16 2025,We always get travel insurance for our overseas trips.  This was the first time we had to file a claim due to flight delays.

3760,IR,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 16 2025,We have had travel insurance on many of our trips but fortunately have never had to use it until now. Your website was easy to navigate. I didn‚Äôt know how to upload documents from my phone so I had to use my scanner and laptop for that   Other than that it was easy to follow and you all were very prompt with your response.  You made a difficult situation much less stressful.  I would definitely recommend you to other travelers.

3780,LH,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 26 2025,I initially gave a lower rating while I waited to see how long it took to receive a paper check. I opted for the paper check as I did not feel comfortable entering my checking account/debit card information. I was very pleasantly surprised how quickly I received my check.

3785,DA,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 16 2025,Easy to use experience and worth the money to have added it. No long waits or issues.
3786,Val,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 16 2025,BUYER BEWARE!!! When filing a claim .. after you've provided all the proof required. They're lazy & refuse to do any of the leg work themselves.

A refund was sent to a debit card number I never provided. After being on hold for 1 hour 23 minutes I had to call back. I was told that I provided a debit card for the refund but when asked to provide the email that they said I responded to with this information, conveniently it's unavailable for viewing. I have no record of an email being sent and in my case file there was nothing showing it either. That's because I NEVER sent anything.  I'm now waiting for my refund via check. And was told I'd receive it in 10 days, well go figure I've received nothing. I want my money!!!!!!!I don't know who you sent the funds to because I didn't provide a debit card and the last for digits you advised they were sent to do NOT belong to me."

Just be patient!Had to cancel our trip when husband fell and broke his leg. Cruise insurance has already approved our claim. This claim for airfare is still in the initial review.

3859,LJ,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 16 2025,"Horrible experience!!! My work trip to California was canceled by my company due to the California wildfires, so I submitted a claim for both my husband and my plane ticket booked through Delta. After submitting all the required documentation, I was being asked by Allianz to submit additional documentation which was a form that not even Delta recognized or was familiar with. The entire claim process was very frustrating and it should not have been. It was very straightforward of why I could not travel to California the week of January 27, 2025. Please do not use and or buy this insurance. It is a scam. Delta reimbursed, both plane tickets. Thank God for Delta."

3945,VB,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 15 2025,"I purchased tickets for an event in the fall. Didn‚Äôt really think about getting insurance, but since the event was held in February, and that‚Äôs when we typically receive bad weather, I figured I‚Äôd pay the $7 for each ticket in case the event was cancelled due to weather. Turns out my mom ended up running a fever the morning of our event and with the flu going around, we didn‚Äôt want to chance anyone else getting it so she decided not to go. I tried finding someone else to use her ticket to no avail. The next morning, while cleaning out my email, I saw where I purchased the insurance. I thought why not. So I made a claim and within 24 hours I had received confirmation it was approved and I was able to get her ticket and fees refunded (a total of $88).  It was a simple process! I‚Äôm glad I decided to purchase the insurance."

So, am I happy with the timing of asking how they did when I haven‚Äôt heard back yet on the claim status? Not particularly.

3952,CR,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 15 2025,"I have always wondered what would happen if I had a reason to claim on this insurance. I dither on whether or not it is worth the price every time I purchase a ticket. This last trip was the first time I had purchased the insurance and actually had what I considered a claimable event. I was very frugal in what I purchased, a meal during a long weather delay. The meal was much lower than the price of the insurance.My claim was denied - because it wasn't a 6 hour delay. The delay was certainly very close to that, I guess I don't understand how the time is figured. I understand that insurance has rules - but once again, when an insurance claim is made - turns out there is some technical rule so that the claim doesn't have to be paid. I assure you I will not purchase the insurance again. And furthermore, I will advise others of my experience."

It just happened to be on the same day of the concert. Family events like this should be listed  & accepted as a legit reason for getting an IMMEDIATE REFUND, especially since ""we"" purchased your insurance policy, you were still going to profit off my purchase. The event was 6 months away & it is an event that is going to be SOLD OUT. You would have easily recouped the full cost of the refund you paid out & would receive another ""insurance purchase fee"" from the resale of the tickets in question."

A relative had given me two tickets for my brother, who is disabled (but does not use a wheelchair) and an attendant to go to the Rockettes. My brother requires TWO attendants to keep him from wandering off and getting lost in crowds, so I purchased another ticket for the second attendant. It turned out that the original pair of tickets required the handicapped person to be in a self provided wheelchair, which was not possible, and the venue did not provide one, so those tickets were cancelled and refunded.  When I tried to do the same with the companion ticket, the refund was denied. So I got nothing for the insurance policy, even though I paid for it."

However, when I actually needed to file a claim, they did everything possible to deny it. Instead of delivering on their promise, they hid behind vague policy language and technicalities to avoid paying out.It‚Äôs clear they‚Äôre in the business of collecting premiums, not providing real coverage. If you‚Äôre considering Allianz for trip insurance, save yourself the frustration and look elsewhere. They sell a false sense of security and will leave you high and dry when you need them most.

We needn't have worried Allianz was extremely easy to contact and worked with the hospital directly to process the claim and with my wife for the incidentals. My pain level had put me in the hospital and had been greatly reduced after my stay, but I still needed to get back home to a Orthopedic doctor for evaluation and treatment. Allianz flew both my wife and me back at their expense and had made arrangements for transportation where we were staying to the airport in Cozumel, wheel chair transfers and transportation from the airport in Minnesota to our home.

4193,JH,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 14 2025,The lack of communication and transparency of updates when someone has filed a claim with this company is shocking. There feels like absolutely no sort of costumer care or service to be had here.
4194,MW,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 14 2025,"I have yet to receive my claim. It was approved. But sent to the wrong account, I triple checked the numbers were correct before submitting so not sure how that happened. I‚Äôve called multiple times and left a request online for a call. Nothing has been resolved."

It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple.

I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
4202,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

4221,EM,2 ‚≠ê,Feb 13 2025,My policy did not auto populate. It took 4 hours to register. I called the help line 3 times and all customer reps gave different responses on why that happened. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told they were on another call and that they would call me back. It‚Äôs been over a week and I‚Äôm still waiting for their call back. I hope if I actually need to use the policy that it works! Not initially happy with this insurance.
4222,SA,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 13 2025,"I've never been one to buy extended warranties or travel insurance on things. However, as I've gotten older, I decided that it was a good idea to invest in it. I didn't have a lot of expectations, but to be fair, I didn't know what to expect. When my vacation plans changed, I figured I was going to have a headache to file my claim. I provided the documents from my airline for what it cost me to get the ticket and the documentation from my employer. I filed the claim and promptly forgot all about it. Two or three days later, I received a notification that I had a new message, including the claim being approved and that I should receive the ACH in the next couple of days. The next morning, my bank already had the ACH. I was astonished and appreciated that my investment in Allianz Travel Insurance was a wise move. Going forward, I'll be adding the protection on my Delta purchases."

When the unexpected has happened, you were there to fully assist and reimburs me.I followed your clear instructions and the next thing was the check covering my entire expense. Thank you for being there."
4309,J SM,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 13 2025,"Thank you Allianz for providing us with assurance that when we travel internationally we can seek medical assistance for a medical emergency without worrying about the cost. Unfortunately during our recent vacation I tripped, fell, and hit my head and both knees on hard tile flooring. Thankfully a trip to the local hospital and a CT scan and X-rays allayed our fears of a brain bleed or broken bones. However, we were a bit worried about the medical bills. Thankfully we had Allianz Insurance, and filing the claim using the app took only minutes ‚Äî using a smartphone! Within a week Allianz made a decision on the claim and a check was sent to our checking account. Thank you for your great service and comprehensive coverage. We will never travel without Allianz again."
4310,KW,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 13 2025,"I suffered a significant medical emergency while on my trip, resulting in emergency surgery and a subsequent hospital stay. Although I have uploaded every single document required by Allianz for this claim, my claim status says ""more info needed"". No one can give me any information, when I call I'm told someone will contact me (that never happens). I will be filing a complaint momentarily with the Department of Insurance & Financial Services."
4311,DF,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 13 2025,"Great service. The process of selecting a policy, explanation of benefits, and claim submittal has been a relatively easy process.  Communication and follow-up questions were clear with prompt replies."
4312,FR,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 13 2025,"We have used multiple travel insurance companies over our many years of travel.Though we rarely have made claims, Allianz ranks at the top re responsiveness to and swiftness of answering them.  They are head and shoulders above most of the other companies out there.  Sometimes premiums are a little pricier, but you get what you pay for.  Beware of other insurance companies' ratings when the raters had no experience other than buying a policy.  The true proof of a company is when you have to deal with an issue.  We heartily recommend Allianz."
4313,VM,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 13 2025,Allianz really came through when I had to cancel a two week cruise.  My travel mate had to have hip replacement surgery and so we couldn‚Äôt go!  Thank goodness for travel insurance!

4318,AF,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 13 2025,"There is no useful reason to purchase this event insurance when you are misled to have coverage, but in all actuality, you do not.The event has been cancelled yet almost 2 full years later, not only has Ticketmaster not refunded my money but the the event insurance has not either. It is a complete waste of money."

4320,JP,3 ‚≠ê,Feb 13 2025,"I‚Äôve purchase insurance from you for 20+ years and have never had to use it until I became ill in Africa, in May of last year! received a payment for the bills from the hospital, but because I had two doctors from the hospital write I had to travel back home in a laydown chair, water 7 more months received about 1/3 of the extra airline charge, I‚Äôm still waiting for the remainder. It should take them 8/9 months to get the refund back, but after sending over 20 pages of proof over 4 times I‚Äôm still waiting. If I haven‚Äôt had Bern so persistence, and still are, I don‚Äôt think they would have sent what was do to me. I‚Äôll wait another 3 weeks and if I don‚Äôt receive the rest of my refund, I will find another company to purchase from."

4426,MG,4 ‚≠ê,Feb 12 2025,"I haven‚Äôt used the travel insurance yet, I bought it on a future flight plan in March.The travel insurance is reasonably priced to cover our travels for a year."
4427,MI,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 12 2025,Customer service was pretty useless and when I read the policy it really does not cover anything. Iw as going to cancel it but I think I missed the deadline.
4428,SC,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 12 2025,"My luggage was stolen from my Hertz rental car in Pisa, Italy. I‚Äôm so glad I got Allianz insurance. After filing with receipts and a copy of the police report, I was able to get the max reimbursement a few weeks later!"

4433,NB,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 12 2025,"Most people who pay for travel insurance rarely end up using it. I always get it for that 'just in case' time I do. I did need it for the very first time ever. I filed a claim when a connecting flight was delayed resulting in me missing a tour. Because Allianz found some fine print somewhere, they declined my claim of $74.37. REALLY?! I will NEVER use your insurance company again. So sad you can't do the right thing and reimburse me."
4434,NE,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 12 2025,I completed the claim on line and found it very easy to do and the turn around time was very fast.  My interaction on the phone was also excellent.
4435,YR,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 12 2025,My flight was cancelled due to weather and Allianz was SO helpful! Submitting a claim was so easy and they followed up on things and asked for additional documentations promptly. I would definitely use them again for my future travels.
4436,DC,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 12 2025,I bought tickets to a basketball game to celebrate my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday.  Thankfully I purchased the insurance because his uncle passed away and we weren‚Äôt able to attend.  If I hadn‚Äôt bought the insurance I would have been out $425.  Getting my money back was easy and fast.  I filed the claim at 5:00 one evening and the money was in my account the next morning!
4437,A D,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 12 2025,"Do not trust them, they are scammers. They will take your money and not give you ANYTHING. I repeat they are scammers and not worth doing business with!!!"

4441,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
4442,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

Allianz reimbursed the fees that were assessed.Then a month later he needed another procedure that caused us to cancel a cruise!  Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.
4445,CR,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 12 2025,"After British Airways stating they were not responsible for my claim,  I sent my claim through the Allianz app. Due to multiple cancelations and delays, I missed a Delta connecting international flight, during peak post Xmas travel.  Allianz app was so easy to use and refunded my total claim ($1650) for the two nights I had to stay in a LHR within 3 weeks. App is super user friendly and I will be renewing my premier annual insurance plan for myself and children every year going forward. Do not hesitate to get your travel insurance through Allianz."

4447,PD,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 12 2025,I filed a claim stating My husband and I had an intestinal flu and wasn't able to do the cruise.  Number 1 reason we didn't want to give it to others on the cruise.

4456,JS,2 ‚≠ê,Feb 12 2025,"I don‚Äôt see the point of buying the supplemental insurance if you‚Äôre not gonna handle the claim faster than 7 to 10 business days. That is ridiculous. The rental car company wanted their money right away so I had to pay it now I‚Äôm just waiting for reimbursement and I think it‚Äôs pretty straightforward so I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôre dragging your feet but that‚Äôs your policy and I think it stinks. I‚Äôm only giving two stars because I‚Äôm happy to have some kind of coverage, but I‚Äôm not happy with your service whatsoever."

Like any insurance policy, you hope you won't have to use it, but if you do you want the process and company to be easy to deal with. We had a cruise scheduled this past January and the day we were to travel, I woke up and felt nauseous. We debated about heading to the airport but I ended up making the call to stay home after seeing another flight for the next day that would have gotten us there in plenty of time before departure. An hour later I was laid up in bed and not moving. I got myself to the doctor that afternoon and they said it was most likely norovirus and I shouldn't be traveling and provided an doctor's note. I submitted a cancellation claim and admit I was skeptical about getting reimbursement, but we had thoroughly read the policy and felt we had met the cancellation reasons. After a few back and forth conversations via the online portal, I got everything supplied and had reimbursement in a few days. Super simple and easy which is what you want. I can't say it enough, read your policy, follow all of the instructions, and don't assume anything. If there's any questions, call support as they are there to assist."

She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"
4659,JY,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,We have purchased travel insurance with Allianz for every of our trips since Covid. The company has excellent customer service. Quick response to all our issues.

4660,DA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,My husband had unexpected open heart surgery that caused us to cancel a trip to see family in December.  We were able to get credits for our air but needed to cancel a non-refundable condo in theCA wine country.  Allianz reimbursed the fees that were assessed.Then a month later he needed another procedure that caused us to cancel a cruise!  Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.
4661,AM,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,I typically don't buy travel insurance. I'm so glad I did for this trip! Allianz's process was incredibly easy and straightforward. Their response time was fast. True professionals who value people's time!
4662,BB,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,I was very impressed on how promptly Allianz handled my claim after the the death of my 98 yr. uncle. I will purchase this insurance in the future for any events that I plan and would highly recommend it.Thanks Again!
4663,UC,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,"I submitted a claim more than 4 weeks ago - for expenses associated when my airline cancelled a flight, and couldn‚Äôt provide alternative transportation for more than 10 days.  Allianz evaluates a claim on a weekly basis.  If something is missing they send you an email.  And then they don‚Äôt look at your claim again for week.  If you don‚Äôt understand what they want - you can‚Äôt reach anyone on the phone who has seen your claim‚Ä¶so that adds a week when they will ask for the same thing again.  Once you manage to guess what they want they move on to the next ‚Äúmissing‚Äù thing- and the cycle repeats."

When I called up your representative had a question about if something happened prior to the start date of that policy what would happen she answered that question. Then she said our policies only for 10,000 for both of us rather than for each. I tried to correct her, but she insisted that it was not so I canceled the policy. And she transferred me to a representative and then I found out that I was correct and she was wrong a bit frustrating."
4673,OR,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,"the process was easy and quick.  the only negative thing i should say is that i thought the insurance would cover the entire amount of the event i was missing.   i bought concert tickets, paid for hotel and i only got the max of $180 (2 people) which didn't even cover the concerts tics so beware!"
4674,EL,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,"I have purchased travel insurance several times and not needed it.  This time I did, and the process worked flawlessly.  With so much else going on, which is why I need to make a claim, I greatly appreciate how easy this was to use. Thank you!"

We spoke with a doctor on a staff persons phone, the doctor prescribed meds which a friend of theirs went and picked up and took his boat out to bring to us. Nothing was on paper- that‚Äôs not how they work. And I told the rep this when I called the day I was so frightened.‚ÄúNo problem‚Äù, he said, ‚Äújust send what you have when you get home.‚ÄùBS.

I have three different answers from three customers support agents and twice I asked for supervisor and always went to voicemail. I left a message and not one called back .this is utterly unacceptable!"
4773,IN,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,"The point of insurance is to be insured. A housekeep invaded my privacy made me so uncomfortable that it made me leave. Entering my room after hours without permission. My trip WAS interrupted, and apparently there's no coverage for if the Hotel/Resort is at fault for my interrupted trip. Why are you even here?????"
4774,AS,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,"Easy to use app, quick response times"

4777,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
4778,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"
4779,JY,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,We have purchased travel insurance with Allianz for every of our trips since Covid. The company has excellent customer service. Quick response to all our issues.

Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.
4781,JK,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,Super easy to use site.
4782,AD,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,I‚Äôve yet to hear back from you regarding my claim! Was it approved? Denied? This was almost 2 weeks ago and this is the first I‚Äôve heard from you..asking me to rate you. I had to cancel my trip before February 3. I made a claim the week prior.
4783,LG,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,The Agent was hopeful with me getting the right information to file my claim. It was all taken care of on one call
4784,Joyce A Reed,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,The process was quick and easy. They fulfilled their agreement. Great to deal with.
4785,KA,4 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,I liked the fact that the money came quicker than other travel insurances. I didn‚Äôt like the amount it wasn‚Äôt everything that I paid out. According to my plan I should have been covered for all trip interruptions.

4788,MP,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,They were very quick to give me a refund for a medical expense incurred but I feel they did not compensate me correctly for that expense.  I also feel they should compensate for a personal item that breaks during an accidental incident - an item considered as a necessity and not a luxury.
4789,TO,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,"We have purchased Allianz Travel Insurance for numerous trips as it was worth the peace of mind and easy to include in the cost of our trips. We recently had a travel delay due to weather and Allianz came through for us and refunded our related expenses. The process for submitting a claim was simple and straighforward. In conclusion, it was worth the peace of mind and the minor added expense."
4790,AM,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,I haven't heard anything regarding the claim I submitted. I hope using the insurance was beneficial. I insured quite a few flights but mine was the only one disrupted.
4791,JS,2 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,My claim still says ‚Äúin review‚Äù. It surprises me that you are asking for feed back prior to the claim being completed. I‚Äôm still waiting for correspondence from Allianz regarding the processing of this claim.

4793,AN,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,I filed my first claim and was pleasantly surprised at how quickly my claim was processed.
4794,RC,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,Allianz Ins was all I hoped it was. I always purchase insurance when I travel just in case something happens. That I was happened in this case. My wife needs urgent knee replacement and Allianz made it easy to file a claim and refund my expenses for the travel.

4799,VB,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 25 2025,I was told my claim was denied because I was claiming for something I wasn't covered for although I have double and triple checked my policy to ensure that it was covered and I provided the correct paperwork. After being denied I queried it again on the website quoting the policy in question and no one has replied to me.Edited to add: After calling and being on the phone for an hour I realized that the paperwork I sent for my claim was insufficient. But instead of saying that I was declined for a false reason. I was able to send new documents to an appeal address and was granted my refund. No accountability from the company for the hassle.
4800,JG,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,The insuance worked just as they said it would with no questions or red tape.

4806,DS,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,"The insurance was not honored as advertised and different explanations for as to why a claim was denied.*****there was INCONSISTENT information from Allianz regarding my claim. I was definitely dissatisfied and disappointed with the lack of cooperation with this submission. A DELAY is a delay, regardless of the ‚Äútimeframe‚Äù. This delay started at 0230 in the morning, which resulted in a series of delays for us.All I ask for Allianz do was Honor the claim, and not hide behind a failure on the part of American Airlines!"
4807,DA,4 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,Needed to file a claim. Process is a bit complicated but thought I had it. Couldn‚Äôt get back to the claim to add receipts.

4810,AG,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,Customer service was very helpful and we received the money back for tickets we could not use due to an illness.  It was a good experience having the insurance.

4816,AL,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,I bought the insurance so if I got delayed I could recoup some costs. Apparently being delayed over 24 hrs isn't enough. No point in buying the insurance

4836,CG,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,Amazing experience and thankful it was such a smooth process. Uploaded documents and with a fee days the fees were covered and in our account. Will definitely cover all trips with Allianz. You can never plan for the unexpected. A sudden death of a family member forced us to cancel within a few days of departure. With Allianz the cancellation expense was not a problem and allowed us to focus on our family.
4837,JM,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,"I am extremely happy for everything!! I submitted my claim and it was just couple of week when I received full compensation for my trip.

4854,CR,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 11 2025,"American Airlines would not compensate me for an overnight stay in Miami (on my return from St. Croix) that was necessary only because they'd sold me an itinerary that, although they did not tell me so at the time, meant that I could not check luggage (because my layover in Miami was too short). When I first looked to Alianz for compensation, they said the same thing American did, which was that my flight from Miami to San Francisco took off on time; yes, but I was not allowed to take that flight! Surprisingly, though, Allianz came through for me in the end. I wouldn't hesitate to get travel insurance through them again."

4888,RT,3 ‚≠ê,Feb 10 2025,"I called for help finding a doctor in the foreign country.  3 times in a row, after I spoke with the person who validated my travel insurance, I was transferred to a survey and then the phone call ended.  Each time I called I spoke with the same person.  The 4th time the person said, OK I'll make sure I get you to the right number this time, and she transferred me to the Canadian branch of the insurance that did not have any record of me.  Then on my own I called another time to the US domestic line and since the person was in the US could not help me find a doctor and just recommended that I find a doctor on my own and put in a claim afterward online. I did not get help and luckily I recovered from my sickness.  Several years back when I was traveling I called the line for assistance and did get  the assistance I needed.  After this last issue I will seek out different travel insurance."

The app is not very user friendly since if you come out of it to upload your document you might get kicked out and have to start over.  It has been about a month now and still processing.  Does this company really think that I tried not to take my trip that I had been planning since September 2024.  I expected quicker service than this.  I think that I would have been better off getting insurance offered with each item than buying an annual plan with Allianz.  I would have my refund by now.Update 3/6/25, still waiting for my trip interruption claim.  I have submitted all the requested documents online and emailed them.

5144,T. Tillman,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 09 2025,"When I discovered that the line up for the concert I purchased tickets for was completely changed (no one on the original show was performing) and Ticketmaster would not refund, I felt cheated. How can you get me to buy tickets for one set of artists but then totally change not only the date but the full line up? Compensation was only offered for the date change and you had 2 weeks. I was fine with the date change. When the line up changed the next month, no notice was given.  I just happened to open the app to show my ticket to someone and saw a different artist. To me, this was fraud. I agreed to pay a certain price for the show I deemed valuable not the one they now are providing. The promoter blocked resale and declined refunds. I called Allianz customer service to understand the eligibility for insurance compensation. I was given clear guidance on what to send in and how to submit the required documentation to prove the situation and has no delays in receiving reimbursement."

5314,CU,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 08 2025,Allianz thinks that everyone books through travel agencies and if you don‚Äôt they ask for documentation that you cannot obtain. Also not everyone prepays hotels. So to ask for proof that no refund was given is a moot point.

When I called to try and reject the decision I was very dissatisfied with the service received. Firstly, the IVR is way too time consuming and annoying. Once I got into contact with a representative she was unable to provide any useful information besides what was already sent in my denial letter. When I asked to speak to a manager she said that there‚Äôs no other high level managers that take calls, which I can guarantee is not true.

5493,JA,2 ‚≠ê,Feb 07 2025,"My husband became ill on our cruise and the charges came out to $7100. The cruise line insisted on being paid upfront and told us we had to file a claim with the insurance. Since it was the beginning of our 45 day trip, I called Allianz because I was worried about having funds for the remainder of the trip and asked them to expedite reimbursement of the claim. This was on January 8, and it is now February 7 and we still have not received reimbursement. Around the end of January I received a email saying they needed ‚Äúmore information‚Äù even though I had already scanned 30 plus pages of medical records provided by the cruise line. I scanned again and am still waiting."
5494,BE,4 ‚≠ê,Feb 07 2025,"The application process was relatively simple. Communication between me and agents was good. Decision for reimbursement was made within the promised time and payment was expedited quickly.Considering how much my husband paid for the initial policy, I was very disappointed that we were not reimbursed for the pre-paid transportation expenses for travel from BCN to hotel and from hotel to cruise ship the following day.Because of trip interruption we were not able to use the paid for transportation."

5496,RC,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 07 2025,I was informed that emergency pet surgery was not a reason for insurance.  We consider our pet part of the family.  It may sound silly but over half of the population does this.  I laugh because this is yet again another example of the unwillingness of insurance to pay and determine any excuse not to pay out.  I have used Allianz a lot in the past and have spent likely hundreds if not thousands of dollars in the insurance.  I will not be using this again and I will inform everyone I know to never use them due to this level of apathy.  The process for the claim is also cumbersome.

5498,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

5506,MI,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 07 2025,Not sure why a person chooses to pay for airline insurance when it is a pain to collect on it.   We had a flight to Mexico for a guided fishing trip and the guide informed us a few days ahead of our trip that Cartel were too bad and they recommended we postpone.I had to submit documentation that this was what we were told and proof of payment etc.   Once again.....Mexico (and Cartel) gets our money.So ridiculous!We won't purchase insurance again.

5529,SB,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 07 2025,"I had to file a claim due to the snowstorm in Atlanta. I had purchased tickets to a play, but driving was extremely hazardous. I spoke to NINE PEOPLE while trying to file this claim. I had to retell my story EVERY time. Be prepared to jump through hoops when you try to file a claim. For example, they ask you to provide your claim # in the subject line of your submission. I did that, but it didn‚Äôt go through. In the subject line I wrote ‚ÄúClaim #xxxx‚Äù. Well.. you can‚Äôt include ANY characters in the subject line except for the numbers of the claim. By writing ‚Äúclaim #‚Äù it caused the submission to fail. Someone COULD HAVE TOLD ME THAT EARLIER!! It was a miserable experience. They finally approved the claim about a month later. So disappointed."
5530,AS,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 07 2025,Terrible. You convinced us to by your insurance to protect and reimburse us for the cost of our flight and then when we make a claim you do everything possible to put up red tape to deny our claim. What a complete and total scam.

I live in Utah so I bought flight tickets, concert tickets, and parking tickets nearing $500 in expenses I lost due to not being able to travel and attend a concert that was cancelled due to these fires.

5589,TF,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 07 2025,I‚Äôve had a terrible time with reimbursement. I was injured in a terrible fall two days before I was supposed to leave. I provided documentation and a physicians letter and x-rays and CT scans that verify that I broke my leg and was unable to travel. I have a doctor‚Äôs letter that said I couldn‚Äôt travel. I have orthopedic Appointments and it‚Äôs been seven weeks and I have not been reimbursed. I just keep getting asked to submit more documents. I‚Äôve provided app number of documents that prove that I have a broken leg and I should‚Äôve been reimbursed by now. This is very frustrating.
5590,JW,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 07 2025,I experienced a prompt review of the issues with my travel. I wouldn't have known about the coverage if it wasn't for my travel agent. I am happy to get some reimbursement!

5597,Maria Knada,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 07 2025,As I was looking around for information on travel insurance I came across the following information online.  I‚Äôm not very good about finding information so I was a little hesitant about going through the hassle of finding a insurance policy. With Allianz I was amazed at how quickly the process was and how reasonable the cost was.  I have not used the service yet for my travel as it will be in May.
5598,SB,2 ‚≠ê,Feb 07 2025,"The claim portion of the application is not clear. When I called in to get clearer instructions instead of answers they repeated the words sent in the letters without clarification. An example, I sent in a copy of my statement showing the cost of the cruise, airfare, taxes, and port costs plus the 100-dollar charge that came when I canceled my cruise because of an emergency operation. If I did go on the cruise I would have either died or would have been paralyzed from the neck down. I  received an email stating that my claim had been finalized but it was over 400 dollars short. When questioned, I was given an answer that was exactly what the email stated but no information as to why my claim was short. I believe this to be the best travel insurance company, but when making a claim there isn't the help the traveler needs."
5599,PC,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 07 2025,I am still waiting on a claim that is a week old. It's not complicated in that my venue was cancelled do to cast illness.

I would not recommend Allianz insurance at this point.

I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
5618,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

I recommend NO ONE use this insurance policy when purchasing tickets, and if you can‚Äôt go you‚Äôre better off selling them at the door of the event to get more money back. This is a complete joke.

5663,KR,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 06 2025,"When I needed medical care in Brazil it was extremely time consuming to get ahold of the correct customer services. Upon arrival in the hospital, despite following instructions, the personnel didn‚Äôt know how to deal with this specific branch of the insurance. Ideally Allianz would connect with their branch in the destination country to provide straight forward service. In the end I had to pay for all medical services out of pocket and provide a lot of documentation to Allianz to request a refund. It was stressful and time consuming which no one needs when feeling sick. I will not be purchasing services with Allianz anymore because the process to get a refund would be the same with my personal health insurance. When I bought their services I was trying to avoid the stress and time it would take to request a refund through my health insurance."
5664,SD,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 06 2025,"I went to see the cruise doctor and submitted my bill to Allianz insurance once we returned home. They refunded my entire bill within a few days. Having trip insurance is a great comfort, especially when you are so far away from home. It gave me peace of mind knowing that any unexpected medical expenses would be covered. The claims process was straightforward and efficient, allowing me to focus on enjoying my trip rather than worrying about costs.

I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
5738,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently.

I had a unique situation because I was moving and also traveling, but my payment ended up coming nearly 3 months after the initial filing, which is a very long time. I needed a direct deposit and it was such a hassle trying to set it up. I just had to deal with having the check mailed, even though I was traveling internationally at the time."

5769,TB,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 06 2025,"I am not entirely certain that this isn't a complete scam. I purchased a pricey set of tickets to a show that canceled without a refund. The only reason that I purchased the ticket insurance in the first place was to protect me from this very thing, but apparently that is not covered by the policy Allianz is peddling. I was apparently misled by Ticketmaster's advertisement of this coverage at the time of purchase. I wonder, do they sell insurance on your ticket insurance? Allianz and Ticketmaster will gladly take your money and give you nothing in return."
5770,LR,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 06 2025,"Within the first week of a month long adventure, I was hit with a sinus infection and coughing.

5771,EJ,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 06 2025,"I've never had to use event ticket insurance before, but I was sure glad I had it for my event after being assigned to work on a Sunday unexpectedly. The representative on the phone explained everything clearly to me--what was needed to file my claim, and where find more information I may need online. After providing the required documents and information, I was equally appreciative of how swift the claim review and refund process was.With cost of concert and festival tickets being as pricey as they are, having ticket insurance is well worth it in the event something unexpected happens.

5806,BI,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 05 2025,Simple honest and direct answers. Thank you. I had purchased a flight via JetBlue on their website when I click to add the $18 insurance it said I had to uncheck it.

We flew into Rome, Italy for our 1st day on the ttrip. Once we landed we noticed one of our bags were missing.Went to the airline to inform them. They said they would investigate. To try to locate it, we called Allianz immediately to tell them. They inform us at the end of our trip. We need to file a claim with them.We went on with our 28 day trip. Got home and filed claim sent in all receipt and information needed.This insurance company after 2.5 mos of back and forth. Tells us that  baggage isn't covered. Which is Absolutely incorrect! It's says it right in our terms. Baggage lost, damaged, or stolen up to 2,000. Unbelievable!!This company is a rip off!! Stay far away!"

I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."

5869,MJ,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 05 2025,"Allianz was great at the beginning of there being a need to file valid Trip Interruption claim - and then Alliianz did everything possible to close claim without settling it  and without even Contacting me, then delayed settling my claim, and avoid paying my claim when I asked what their delay was. Then friends confirmed Allianz played the same Avoid & Deny games with them.  I cannot recommend any company who thoroughly avoids helping their customers get their fair and due refund. It was emotionally painful working with a company who did all possible to avoid taking responsibility for paying out on a valid claim!  SHAME on Allianz for teaching so many of their employees to deny paying claims with the hope their customers will give up in frustration trying to get refunded for valid claims. I'm now trying to find a Travel Insurance company who will honor their claims policies and not try to cheat their customers.  Avoid Allianz because you just might have a valid claim and they'll do all possible to not pay it."

5894,RC,4 ‚≠ê,Feb 05 2025,"Allianz honored my claim as promised. There was little interaction required, which was both a positive and a negative. What it required was extreme patience and trust from me as I awaited results of my filed claim. From Start to Finish, this process took 6 months with several vague general messages from Allianz about the information required. This entailed me running around to various MD's to try to get them to fill out an Allianz form, which of course they refused to do and instead sent letters which I then copied and submitted through the Allianz portal. Then I waited for a reply.  Two months in the dark and to my surprise I received notice that my claim was complete.  Despite the prolonged period of uncertainty and lack of direct verbal communication, the result was a check that fully paid my claim. My rating is 100% for result and 10% for style."

She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

5965,DR,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 05 2025,Our claim was rejected. My husband was asked to be in the funeral (reading and pallbearer) for his cousin. The claim rejected it because a cousin isn't considered a family member. I am disappointed by this decision. I called the 800- number on the email to have a 19 minute phone called where the person at the end only reread the email that I was sent.

5969,GR,3 ‚≠ê,Feb 05 2025,I didn't realize there would be so much involved in justifying my need to cancel and be reinbursed.  It took longer to hear back than stated.  I was happy it was approved but I wasn't sure if it was being reviewed as I didn't have a doctor's report concerning my brother who was hospitalize and no one responded to my question about it's necessity.

5984,Joseph Aspromonti,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 05 2025,What‚Äôs the point of buying insurance on a ticket in case I can‚Äôt make the show and having the claim denied when something comes up?  You make it virtually impossible to recover the money spent on a ticket and I will never use your company ever again. I will also discourage anyone else I know to use your service.

5987,VI,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 04 2025,I paid a good premium price for my travel to the Philippines and subsequently join a cruise with Norwegian to tour Asia. Barely had we joined the cruise only for the second day and my husband got seasick and the ship rejected our reembarkation to finish the rest of the tour. We spent the night where they left us and booked a flight to Manila. Your insurance paid us $1500 ONLY for all the expenses incurred. That is so unfair. You guys are a scam

6071,OR,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 04 2025,"Long story short, like when most people purchasing airfare tickets they are usually offered the travel protection service (which is at an additional cost), at the very end right before checking out.  I usually do not purchase this service as I am usually on a very tight budget but in this case, I was traveling to an area known for major snow storms and I purchased the additional insurance from Allianz. This turned out to be the best decision of my travels as my return flight was not only postponed (first), then canceled completely thus causing additional lodging expenses which were expected or accounted for.I really did not think this expense would have been covered for reimbursement by Allianz but I started a claim and submitted my receipt with a short description. Within 24 hours Allianz had received my claim, reviewed my claim, and accepted my claim.I was very happy to say the least and even with being on a budget when I travel, I will try to accommodate enough to include the travel insurance by AllianzI definitely recommend it or at least recommend considering it."

It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
6074,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"
6075,JY,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,We have purchased travel insurance with Allianz for every of our trips since Covid. The company has excellent customer service. Quick response to all our issues.

6076,DA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,My husband had unexpected open heart surgery that caused us to cancel a trip to see family in December.  We were able to get credits for our air but needed to cancel a non-refundable condo in theCA wine country.  Allianz reimbursed the fees that were assessed.Then a month later he needed another procedure that caused us to cancel a cruise!  Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.
6077,FY,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 04 2025,They had a very quick response to my issue.
6078,Patty Gelbrich,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 04 2025,"I purchased Allianz for my holiday trip over Christmas break. Holiday travel is always a bit risky with weather, crowded flights, etc. Our trip went great until the very end, the last flight home where our incoming flight took off late due to snow, and then could not land due to fog.  After lots of hoping it would arrive, the flight was cancelled.  Allianz was helpful, and reimbursed for all the expenses incurred as we pivoted to getting home in a different way."
6079,CU,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 04 2025,Our claim was paid within a week of filing
6080,DM,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 04 2025,I paid for ticket insurance that they said could be used in case of inclement weather. I tried to claim when the weather was too bad for me to make the 65 mile drive to attend. They denied my claim and would not refund the tickets.
6081,CM,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 04 2025,I had a refundable for any reason ticket and was denied for my claim due to not being able to travel. My claim was denied. I‚Äôll never buy travel insurance again because this tells me it‚Äôs a ripoff

6083,ML,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 04 2025,The procedure was simple.
6084,SJ,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 04 2025,"Easy to choose the options that make the most sense for your travel needs! I travel a LOT and with my annual travel policy via Allianz, I know I'm good to go if just about ANYTHING happens on my travels.  The coverage is affordable and the claim service is easy to use and fast.  My first claim (a canceled trip to Italy due to COVID), went through without a hitch.  My second claim, they wanted to argue with me about the cause of cancellation, even though I had purchased the ""Cancel for any reason"" and I finally gave up, since I found a new travel partner to go with.  Note:  if you want the ""cancel for any reason"" do not buy an annual policy.  You'll want to purchase the individual policy for your trips.But, overall I have recommend Allianz to all of my friends who travel regularly."
6085,BA,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 04 2025,"As a repeat customer, it was easy to get a new quote being familiar with the site.  Wished you would retain information since it is in your records, hopefully secure."

Winter storm blare canceled all my flight but I still had to be at work on Monday, so I had to get a rental car and drive 22 hours.

6108,BS,3 ‚≠ê,Feb 04 2025,"Very slow to review claims, don't give clear explanation of what's needed. For example, the claim requires a trip itinerary but its not clear what's needed since not all trips have a itinerary by definition. For my flight, i used miles and there was no reason to include that in my mind but it's required for your org to see the dates and again this is not clear and should be noted on the page where it requests documents. This would save time for your customers."
6109,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 04 2025,I was very happy how smoothly the process went getting a refund after my brother got sick and we were unable to attend an event.I was impressed that I was able to talk to actual people within minutes of calling Allianze.  I will be using them for future events and trips.

6115,LO,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 04 2025,"I uploaded your APP for my phone and no matter how many times I tried to log in with my password it never worked.  I called you and was told there is a problem with users on MAC Apple products including iPhones and to try again on a Saturday?!  I have tried multiple times since then with no luck, no access.  When I  try to change my password I am told to enter the code sent to my email, either the code does not arrive or when it does arrive, it is not accepted!!  I am sorry I signed up with your company.  If this is how things are run, I have absolutely NO confidence in the integrity of Allianze."

6129,Jamal Meyers,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 04 2025,This was by far the worse experience I have had with paying 27$ for insurance to get my money back for a flight. After losing my brother n law they want 8 documents for me to get a full refund on my flight ticket which would be crazy to even call my family that is grieving to ask for a dam death certificate for this. If you wanna throw away some money go ahead and use Allianz insurance there are too many hidden agendas in their policies for me never again will I donate another penny of my money to them delta airlines just give me my flight credit back please and thank you

6154,CG,2 ‚≠ê,Feb 04 2025,We had a delayed flight that caused us to miss a connecting flight which means we had to get a rental car to drive home instead. We purchased the Allianz insurance in case something like that happened.

Traveling is already hectic enough - we'll just pay a higher price for the flight next time to be able to make changes through the airline.

The claim was finalized on January 14, 2025, with a payout of $1,600, which is incorrect based on my policy coverage and submitted documentation.Upon reviewing the details, it is clear that Allianz miscalculated the reimbursement amount by basing the payout on the wrong trip cost. The original cost of my trip was $2,899, and I received a $400 discount, making my final out-of-pocket cost $2,499. However, Allianz incorrectly applied the 80‚Äì85% refund policy to a $2,000 trip cost, leading to an underpayment of approximately $400.I brought this error to your attention immediately, but instead of reviewing my documentation properly, I was dismissed and told that the underwriter‚Äôs decision was final. I then obtained additional documentation from the travel agency that clearly outlines the correct trip cost and resubmitted the required paperwork on January 15, 2025. Despite this, I have yet to receive the corrected payment, and I find this delay unacceptable.Requested Action:1. Immediate correction of my claim payout to reflect the correct reimbursement amount based on my out-of-pocket cost of $2,499.2. Written confirmation of the claim correction and an estimated timeline for the additional payment.Escalation & Next Steps:If Allianz fails to correct this error within 10 business days, I will escalate this matter further by:Filing a formal complaint with my state‚Äôs Department of Insurance regarding the mishandling of my claim.Submitting a complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for failure to honor policy terms.Reporting my experience to the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and other consumer advocacy groups.Reconsidering my future business with Allianz, including my three existing Cancel Anytime policies.As a loyal Allianz policyholder with multiple upcoming trips insured under your company, I expect professional service, accurate claim processing, and prompt corrections when errors occur. The way this claim has been handled has been substandard, and I am deeply disappointed by the dismissive attitude I have encountered when simply asking for my rightful reimbursement.Please respond in writing via email at  by mail at the address provided above. I expect a resolution by  10 business days from 2/3/2025.Sincerely,LaTanya P Jones"

6263,AE,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 03 2025,"I am writing to express my extreme frustration with Allianz Partners USA, as my experience with them has been nothing short of a nightmare. I was involved in an accident and filed a claim in good faith, expecting that the company would follow through on its promises and provide me with the support and reimbursement I needed. However, it has now been months since I filed the claim, and I am still dealing with a lack of resolution.The worst part of this entire process has been the incredibly slow and unhelpful response times. I‚Äôve had to follow up multiple times, and every time, I am either given vague responses or simply ignored. It has been impossible to get any clear answers about my claim status, and despite providing all the required documentation, they continue to drag their feet.Not only have I had to wait for months without any real progress, but now Allianz Partners USA is outright refusing to resolve my issue. They have made no effort to address my concerns or provide any kind of acceptable solution. I have reached out for help with covering the expenses I‚Äôve incurred, and each time, I am met with unhelpful responses and empty promises.This is not just a case of bad service; it feels like I‚Äôve been deliberately ignored and mistreated by a company that should be offering support in times of need. Instead of taking responsibility for the situation, Allianz is passing the buck and making no effort to rectify the issue. The stress and frustration of dealing with them have only worsened my situation, as I have now been left with significant financial burdens that should have been covered.It feels like they are playing games with me, refusing to take accountability for their lack of service and refusal to honor their commitments. The lack of professionalism and basic customer service is absolutely appalling. I trusted Allianz to be a reliable partner, but instead, I feel completely let down and ignored.If you are considering Allianz Partners USA for any type of insurance or assistance, I strongly advise you to think twice. They have shown me nothing but disrespect and incompetence, and I am still left without the support I need. I will never use their services again, and I will be sharing this experience with as many people as possible to warn them of the unacceptable treatment I‚Äôve received.Allianz Partners USA‚Äôs complete failure to resolve my claim, the months of waiting with no progress, and their refusal to take responsibility has been disastrous. If you want a company that will actually provide the service they promise, avoid Allianz at all costs."

6293,Laura Veronica,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 03 2025,I am unable to submit more documents you say you need and the problem is on your end not mine. I need and deserve my refund I paid for the insurance you shouldnt make it so difficult for people in need after a very serious health issue. I most certainly didn‚Äôt want or ask for this situation or having to cancel a trip I‚Äôve wanted to take my entire life.  The stress of worrying about this just adds to what I‚Äôm going through. It‚Äôs not right.
6294,AN,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 03 2025,Speedy response to my request.
6295,TD,4 ‚≠ê,Feb 03 2025,"Easy to get a quote and get the insurance. Reasonable prices. Travel app is giving me issues as I am not able to log in. They send a code, then when entered, states code is wrong. This has happened numerous times. Using the website is easier."
6296,Donna,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 03 2025,"I had a wonderful experience with Allianz. I couldn‚Äôt attend a concert due to a fall, and the filing process from beginning to end was easy, and done quickly. Two days for approval and payment. I went to my doctor when I fell and asked for a letter to Allianz. As long as you follow directions, you shouldn‚Äôt have a problem filing a claim. I read reviews with some people complaining, and it sounds like people didn‚Äôt do that from their explanations."
6297,AS,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 03 2025,"I paid for insurance for my flight and they won't give me a refund. My daughter was sick that day of the flight and they want a proof, but I didn't take my daughter to the doctor, I just didn't want to leave her home alone."
6298,RC,4 ‚≠ê,Feb 03 2025,Got refunded...Thanks

6300,RS,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 03 2025,I couldn't make the show.  Filed a claim and was reimbursed within 4 days.  Great service.
6301,RA,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 03 2025,I was disappointed when asked for a doctor‚Äôs opinion about my recent cancellation of a trip due to illness. Sometimes common courtesy for fellow travelers and family does not require an official medical document for a passing virus. I was appreciative when Allianz recognized this and upheld their responsibility in my very small claim.Thank you.
6302,SS,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 03 2025,"With mom's health in decline, we have always purchased this travel insurance when we fly to visit. This time the insurance helped tremendously. When she passed, we had to pay to change our flights. Allianz covered the cost of the change, and we are thankful for that!"

6307,VH,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 03 2025,"Having Allianz travel insurance gave us piece of mind during winter travel, when storms and delays are so common. The rates were very affordable for the coverage provided. We will definitely precise travel insurance in the future."
6308,GP,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 03 2025,"I‚Äôve never had to use my insurance but purchased just in case like I always do, this time my dad ended up in the hospital & was able to go out to see him earlier than planned to be by his side! I‚Äôm forever grateful because of the Allianz‚Äôs insurance that‚Äôs helped during this time!!"
6309,JM,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 03 2025,We had to cancel our trip at the last minute due to a family emergency.

I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
6314,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

6318,DE,2 ‚≠ê,Feb 03 2025,"Not impressed with the amount of work I would need to expend to get a refund for my expenses. Alliance knew my flight was delayed and that I missed my connection because I kept getting alerts from them. Everything is digital now and the effort it would take to submit the necessary documentation of having to spend the night at a hotel, missing a day of work, not having toiletries or my clothes, is just too much of a burden to get $2 or $3 hundred dollars. I‚Äôm ready to put the trip behind me but the insurance didn‚Äôt help at all."
6319,ES,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 03 2025,"Great customer service in purchasing the policy, and when we needed to make a claim it was very easy to do so online, and was quickly approved. I would definitely use Allianz again in the future!"

6336,SE,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 03 2025,"I‚Äôm really disappointed I couldn‚Äôt get a full refund for my ticket. I cancelled 5 months in advance because my mom is chronically ill at the moment (a circumstance no one saw coming nor could and/or can control). The lady I spoke with also didn‚Äôt show any sympathy or empathy for my situation. Not sure if I‚Äôll purchase travel insurance through them again, it‚Äôs really disappointing, and i could‚Äôve really used the money, especially at a time like this."

Medical procedure was rescheduled due to the surgeon‚Äôs availability. Called Allianz right away and was told my reason wasn‚Äôt approved and required review. Submitted documentation but would be 7-10 business days to review. Tomorrow is day 10, no answer yet. Highly frustrating! A RESCHEDULED TRIP OUT OF STATE FOR SURGERY IS NOT COVERED and needs special approval. However, if you have to work, have childcare fall through, or just get sick, you‚Äôre covered.Absolutely will not ever purchase this coverage again. Poor customer service, and false advertising. I hope they make it right."

6464,QW,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 02 2025,"I missed the flight because someone else had a car accident on the way. I didn't even think about taking photos at the time. But when I asked you for compensation, you asked me to provide photos of the car accident. If I didn't have them, there would be no compensation. This is totally unreasonable."

They mislead and deceived me and I won‚Äôt stand for that.  They should be giving me the money I paid the insurance for. I‚Äôm glad I have platforms to share my experience on. I want my money back, that‚Äôs why I purchased the insurance. I have six tickets, I need the money back on two. It is a company who should be doing the right thing but certainly aren‚Äôt!"

6542,CU,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 01 2025,"Your company is deceptive when selling your product.  When I purchased a ticket for a close family friend (my wife‚Äôs best friend from nursing school) to come and surprise my wife for her 75th birthday, your promotion appeared right under the Delta Airlines request for credit card payment.  At our age, anything can happen, so I purchased insurance from Allianz for the flights.  Since there is a legitimate possibility of snow in Detroit, and even in Richmond, in late December, not to mention the possibility of a surprise medical issue, I felt my choice to insure the flights was prudent.  Well, my wife came down with a nasty cold several days before the friend was to depart.  As the departure date neared, her health did not improve.  The night before the flight to Richmond the friend and I decided to cancel our plans, and reschedule her visit for sometime in the spring.  Who wants to have company when you‚Äôre feeling miserably?!  My wife certainly would not!  I notified Delta at once, cancelling the friend‚Äôs flights.  After jumping through hoops to file my claim, your company refused my request because the friend was not a family member!  If your promotion was not present when I purchased the tickets, I could have made other arrangements, and with a company that would honor the obligation created when they sold the product.  I have informed Delta about the deception that I experienced, a situation that they indirectly endorsed.  I would not be surprised if they reconsider their relationship with your company."

I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
6554,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently.

6559,AC,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 01 2025,"The claims submission portal was very confusing, it felt like every step was designed to confuse and trip me up to prevent my claim from being covered. Also their coverage only seems to be useful if you have a flight cancelled or a documented health emergency. I have a partner that struggles with mental health, so for my next trip I'll look elsewhere for a more generous policy that covers delays due to panic attacks."

6590,MI,2 ‚≠ê,Feb 01 2025,I haven't received any updates on my claim. So I can't say anything great right now. I just feel in limbo on what's going on.

I filed a claim well over a week ago, I had to provide proof of my reason for not attending the event, despite Xgames website saying specifically I could cancel my plans for any reason if I purchased ticket insurance. I sent a photograph of my invoice/bill from the car repair shop. Highly doubt I'll ever get my money back from this company. This company is dishonest and a waste of your money. Wish I had saved the nearly $20 extra I spent to ""insure"" my tickets. I will never use this companies services again."
6592,DV,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 01 2025,About 8 or 9 years ago I travel to Australia and I bought Health Travel Insurance Plan with Allianz.

6616,Michael Stagnone,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 01 2025,They did what I paid for. I‚Äôm not sure what you want a review of this. These surveys are self-serving to companies that want to get praise that they can publish to social media. The person who helped me probably gets no benefit from this. I wish them all the best. I recommend that they get a $20/hr raise‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre worth it.
6617,JI,2 ‚≠ê,Feb 01 2025,"All claims should be accessible after submission for new documents to be uploaded, if necessary. Sending documentation to a random email seems disorganized. My phone call was not a pleasant experience to ask how to submit two different claims for the same plan. The rep was abrupt and gave me another email address to send documentation to. Claims transparency is so easy as it can be easily paralleled to health insurance and property/casualty insurance."

We had insurance but Alliance only honored half of our claim
6632,Marcy,5 ‚≠ê,Feb 01 2025,I was shocked to receive a check from Allianz Travel Insurance in a matter of days and very little contact.  I filed my complaint and in a matter of days I had a refund check!  I will definitely go with Allianz each time I travel!

6638,Mark Good,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 01 2025,"This company issues nonsense insurance policies that do not provide even the most basic of coverage.  I purchased this ""insurance"" commensurate with a flight purchase.  The airlines then unilaterally changed the flight to a departure time before my cruise boat arrived in port making it impossible to make the changed flight.  The airlines happily refunded my pre-paid flight charges, but Allianz refused to reimburse me for the amount paid to them for the now useless insurance policy.In particular, Allianz denied reimbursement stating:Thank you for choosing Allianz Global Assistance. Based on the information provided, we regret to inform you that we cannot issue a payment for your claim because:Your insurance program provided Trip Cancellation benefits for very specific reasons. Unfortunately, the travel carrier moving your flight earlier is not included among those reasons.""The insurance is therefore worthless."

6651,JY,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,We have purchased travel insurance with Allianz for every of our trips since Covid. The company has excellent customer service. Quick response to all our issues.

6652,DA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,My husband had unexpected open heart surgery that caused us to cancel a trip to see family in December.  We were able to get credits for our air but needed to cancel a non-refundable condo in theCA wine country.  Allianz reimbursed the fees that were assessed.Then a month later he needed another procedure that caused us to cancel a cruise!  Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.
6653,BM,1 ‚≠ê,Feb 01 2025,"We purchased travel insurance for our trip to Italy. Due to a mechanical issue with the plane we were delayed till the next day, which made us lose one night in Venice. The hotel rate was close to $800 a night. Allianz Would only cover $150 per person because we weren‚Äôt missing 24 hours of our trip. Even though I provided ample evidence that we literally lost out on one night at a luxury hotel, they would not refund us our hotel night nor the Taxi that we had to prepay. Thank goodness that Delta made us whole with the airline credit. This company should do a better job at explaining their reimbursement policy prior to you purchasing travel insurance."

I completed the reimbursement form on the Allianz site about 10:30 PM on a Wednesday. Thursday morning I received an email. The email told me they were working on my request.  Thursday evening, I received an approval of my total reimbursement.  3 days later, I had a check in my hands. We have had the Annual Allianz plan for at least 8 years. My husband and I have had excellent service from them. We have had both medical and Hurricane claims approved. I recommend Allianz Annual insurance to all my travel friends and family.

On 1/22, I received that email and after multiple failed attempts to input both my card and bank information and receiving an error, I called you all to see what was wrong.

I then confirmed my account ending in 9005 was the account I‚Äòd like the funds deposited into. On 1/24, I received an email stating that a check would be mailed out to me. After emailing back and asking why I was receiving this when I had requested and confirmed an electronic deposit, I was met with no response.

6752,JR,4 ‚≠ê,Jan 31 2025,"The phone staff was good‚Ä¶they listened and offered do-able alternative solutions to problems.  One star is off because I don‚Äôt understand why I had to provide flight itineraries when I already provided the Airports, the Airline, the flight numbers, the dates and times of the flights.  In this technological age, I think the Insurer (as much as they deal with the various airlines) would have an easier time getting at itineraries than I did, after I had already found it necessary to cancel my trip due to sudden illness.  I will never again delete anything related to travel until I have returned from my trip."

Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

6779,WK,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 31 2025,"When in needThe company has always been easily available if I need assistance.  Fortunately, I have not in my recent travels.  But I trust that they will be there, when or if, I do."

6784,AW,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 31 2025,"Good Customer ServiceThe reason for our trip was unexpectedly canceled, and I found myself needing to cancel the nonrefundable reservation.  I am so glad I bought the travel insurance. I had an issue with my submission request through the online form probably due to connection issues, so I had to use the chat feature to contact customer service.  The representative was able to add the information that was missing and tell me how to submit additional documents that didn't attach to the original submission.  It was initially a bit of a headache, but the representative made it manageable.  Once the claim was submitted, the review was very quick as was the payment.  I especially appreciated the direct payment into my bank account even though I could only recoup 80% of the cost of my trip. I would definitely recommend Allianz."
6785,TE,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 31 2025,Only paid part of the meals and room for a mechanical delay that cost us over 24 hrs and had us stay overnight. Less than $40.00 paid when the insurance cost twice that

6810,AR,3 ‚≠ê,Jan 31 2025,Online application took too long.  Does not explain the difference in coverages so I filled out 3. A waste of time. Phone call would be quicker.
6811,SM,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 31 2025,The process for trying to request a refund is excessive. If I am going to pay for insurance then I should be able to use that insurance no matter the situation. Currently has been over a week since filing my claim and I have had no response from the company and it says my status is being reviewed. The event that I purchased tickets for almost a week away and if the company continues to delay then I will not have enough time to at least sell the tickets to recover partial of the cost.

6823,AT,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 31 2025,"Such an EASY process! I never thought I would actually need to use the travel insurance, but I am SO glad that I purchased it with Allianza. While sitting in the airport I was able to call and confirm coverage for my canceled flight (which caused me to unexpectedly need to stay at a hotel) in no time. There was not a long wait time and the representative was able to pull up my coverage and confirm in under 10 minutes. Once I got home, I was able to upload the receipts easily and was pleasantly surprised when my refund was deposited to my bank account WITHIN 72 hours!!!

The full refund was in my account in less than 2 days. It helped take some of the sting out of a stressful situation.
6839,MI,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 31 2025,The online claim process was pretty easy and straightforward. They kept me informed of the status of my claim all the way and processed it very quickly. The only think that was somewhat confusing was the process of uploading receipt documentation. I resorted to uploading a few receipts twice under different categories since they did not fit neatly into one of the pre-made categories. But I was very pleased with how they handled things all the way around.

Thanks for nothing I guess I‚Äôll just shell out another 690 bucks to replace it myself.

6859,Charles Behrmann,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,"We were incredibly disappointed that our claim was denied. We were supposed to fly home from PHX the day of the IT outages (Microsoft/Crowdstrike) and because of it could not fly out- nobody had any idea what was happening, a timeline when things would be fixed, or any other info.We were able to be reimbursed for our plane ticket through Allegiant for the trip home, but we had to rent a car to get home (a 27 hour drive with a hotel stay in there) which was $800 more than if we would have flown home.I started the claim with what receipts and paperwork I had available while my wife was driving and I added and updated the items as we went.I got an email that the claim was denied with no reason or explanation.Finally I reached out to see what the reasoning was and the answer I got was mind blowing- They didn't cover IT outages. Isn't the purpose of insurance to cover UNEXPECTED things from happening- a travel interruption in this case?Granted the insurance was not very expensive, but we are still paying for fees we incurred on this trip 7 months ago because the car rental and hotel stay was not covered even partially by the Allianz insurance."
6860,AA,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,What's the point of insurance if you don't get protection for cancelation?
6861,SR,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,I am writing this review as I got claim from your insurance. I missed my flight because of immigration process. I put a claim by thinking it works or not because I am first time traveller in domestic airlines in USA. I put a claim in the morning by adding all additional exp I incurred and I received a claim by day end without any phone call for very verification. It was so helpful and I trust your company

6863,TB,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,Easy to use website. Options and information is easy to find and navigate. Easy to access.
6864,BA,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,"Apparently buying insurance is just for if THEY mess up. If I have anything happen and try to fix it, insurance doesn‚Äôt cover it. I tried to move my flight 24 hours before my ticketed time and I lost out on that money because they couldn‚Äôt help me. Don‚Äôt buy insurance to insure your own mishaps. Only buy it for if the flight gets delayed. Which I think SHOULD ALREADY BE COVERED CAUSE ITS THEIR FAULT. I‚Äôm not bitter."

6876,JW,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,The agent that took my call was so nice! She took the time to listen to what I needed. She reviewed the travel policy I had and helped me add my son. All in less that 10 minutes!

In order to get my money back from the insurance I PURCHASED AT AN ADDITIONAL COST to protect my ticket purchase‚Ä¶ I have to contact my last employer and get the details of my termination on letterhead to send it to Allianz to get a refund which is obscene. ‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ I know I was let go and haven‚Äôt spoken to anyone in months but can you write this letter for me so I can get SOME of the money I spent on tickets back.‚Äù Who is doing that???Allianz Global is a complete scam and I am going to let everyone I can know to NEVER purchase their insurance.

6882,LM,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,It made it easy to obtain a refund for tickets I was unable to use.

6884,KF,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,Cannot get a response from anyone!!!  I need someone to know I‚Äôm trying to get documents from Carnival Cruise Lines for the medical visit I had but am struggling.  My policy ends 2/1 and new one starts 2/2.  Am I going to lose the ability to file the claim after 2/1?
6885,HI,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,"I have been waiting for a call back re: my claim. I called before filing it, as my trip that was canceled due to a broken ankle, which required surgery, was originally scheduled to start on a date during my initial Policy and ending during my renewed policy. Allianz assigned two different policy numbers, but the entire time was covered. When I called, they told me to put the claim through on the first policy # and make a note of the second one, which I did. It was denied. I called and was told someone would call me so that we could get it fixed. No one has called. Nothing has been taken care of yet.."
6886,SC,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,Rapid turn-around time to receive the claim reimbursement.
6887,KD,3 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,Unsure how to rate Allianz at this time. I am waiting on a decision on a claim for an event refund.
6888,DM,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,"Excellent service. Easy to use. And great peace of mind knowing we're covered. We bought the annual policy, and it's well worth it!"
6889,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
6890,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective.

She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.
6893,PA,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,"I've submitted multiple emails that explains the issues I've encountered with Allianz (never received a confirmation email nor invoice although I did receive statement within Ticketmaster that my tickets were covered through Allianz).   Upon calling and emailing the numbers provided for Allianz, I worked with two reps who were unknowledgable and non helpful.   The third rep was helpful but upon finally getting the policy written that I had elected, the claims process was substantially more restrictive than was promoted when I elected it upon purchase of tickets"

6918,LB,4 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,"Response after filing a claim was extremely fast, maybe TOO fast. Initially my claim was approved for a partial payment when it should have been paid in full. No explanation was given. I called customer service who looked at my policy, said it was probably a mistake & sent the claim to an examiner again. Within 2 weeks I had the full payment for the claim. Still no reason given why it was partial at first."

6920,RF,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,We were fully refunded. Note: if you were ill you will need to have Doctors Chart Notes showing you could not travel. The wait for a refund took a couple of weeks. Also note that when you call the to file a refund that the representatives are non-sympathetic.

6924,ELROY COMBS,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,This was the most unethical decision I‚Äôve experienced since using the Allianz insurance option!!!!The computations formula is NOT disclosed in the contract information when selecting to purchase the travel insurance.I will be seeking ways to correct this wrongful decision.
6925,DO,4 ‚≠ê,Jan 31 2025,"Quick reimbursement, but the rep I spoke with couldn‚Äôt elaborate on what the ‚Äúother documents they might request‚Äù are, which stressed me out. We all know insurance is always looking for a way to squirm out of paying, so I wasn‚Äôt sure if they were setting me up for failure by being vague here. If I can provide an obituary as requested, what else do you need? Under what conditions would that not be enough? Just confused why they couldn‚Äôt answer this."

It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
7010,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

7028,KD,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,"To be honest, I was leery when i submitted my claim as I had heard from more than one person that it takes forever to get claims processed and they do everything possible to ""not"" pay out.I was more than impressed with the speed my claim was processed. I completed the fom on my phone and uploaded one photo confirming an ER visit which kept us from attending our event.I expected to hear back in 5-10 days. I was shocked that within a few hours my claim was processed and my full refund for our tickets was in my checking account.Best $20 insurance I've ever spent."
7029,AL,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,"I made a mistake and put in April 3 as the date our travel begins, when in fact, it is April too. A telephone call to your agent was handled very well. The change was made to April 2 and concluded very satisfactory."

7031,OL,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,Our last flight was cancelled and we needed to get home so we had to rent a car and Allianz covered the cost of the car and the gas we paid to top off the tank. Worth it when traveling in the winter with lots of delays and cancellations.

7038,LS,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,"I just renewed my annual policy. It‚Äôs relatively inexpensive, the cover is pretty extensive (covers a lot of possible reasons you may need to cancel a trip). I travel a lot, and each time I book a flight or a hotel room there is an offer to buy insurance, this is a cheaper option."

By the time we were able to get connecting flights, we would have missed five days of an 11 day trip.  Very disappointing!  Allianz came through reimbursing us for all of our trip expenses.  Very easy to work with as long as you keep good records of all your expenses.  I highly recommend Allianz although I hope to never have to experience this process again! Keep on traveling but always have travel insurance for these unexpected events."
7042,JL,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,I submitted all the paperwork and was really surprised that had a payout the next day. Very fast
7043,MY,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,The agent on the phone was so nice and knowledgeable about the process. Submitting my claim online was seamless and I had notice my claim was approved in less than 24 hours from submitting. Couldn‚Äôt have been an easier process overall.
7044,RH,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,"I bought insurance before a trip, specifically in case something came up before the trip and we had to cancel.  My husband ended up in the emergency room and we did have to cancel.  When I  put in the claim, we were denied because it didn't happen during the trip. They said it was stated in the policy. I'm sure it probably was, and my own fault for not seeing it, but those policies are so long and so complicated,  I  find them very difficult to read and comprehend all the jargon, which I'm sure they count on. VERY disappointed."

I wasn't worried about getting my money back because I purchased the extra insurance. When I filed my claim I was told that my reasoning was not valid enough to get a refund. The thing that upsets me the most is that I purchased the extra insurance for reasons like this.I honestly feel like if you purchase the insurance no matter what the reasoning was you should get 100% refund back. I will never get supplemental insurance through this company again.

In as much as we would really have wanted to go on this cruise, but circumstances out of our control medically we had to cancel. They made a very bad situation seem so much better.

After filing with Alliance, I learned quickly what was needed so the company could verify my claims.  Hence we received approval and direct deposit in short order. Thanks for not dragging this out."

7215,Michelle Medlock Adams,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 28 2025,"I bought the insurance for our upcoming conference trip in Fort Worth, Texas, just in case we'd have to cancel due to bad weather. But, on the morning we were supposed to fly into Texas, I woke up in the wee hours with the stomach flu, preventing me from leaving the bathroom, let alone boarding a flight. So we had to cancel the whole trip. Because it was a stomach bug--not needing antibiotics, I didn't go to the dr. I just had to ride it out, so to speak. So, because I didn't have a dr's note, they would not honor my insurance which means I can't get reimbursed for the whole trip. When I explained that I didn't go to the dr's office because I was told not to--just to keep hydrated and ride it out, they were unsympathetic and insisted on a dr's note, which of course, I didn't have. Such a waste of money. Very disappointed."

For example, it's essential when asking a client for additional documentation to identify the documentation that is needed. It would also be less frustrating when asking for a client to submit documentation, that the process for uploading it works correctly.

Nothing usually goes wrong, but in case it does! you expect for the travel insurance you buy to finally be of use. then of coarse whatever went wrong on your trip just so happens to not be covered!"
7369,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
7370,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.

My partner (who was traveling with me and submitted a similar claim on the same date and with similar details as mine) already received the approval for his claim and had funds deposited. Whereas my claim is still under review and no other communication has been provided regarding my claim."
7385,KD,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 28 2025,"I have requested minor reimbursement for interruption in travel. Allianz is requiring a document that the airline is refusing to provide. This document will force the airline to admit fault and affect their reviews.It is not right for the customer to have to fight with the airlines to get their rightful insurance claim. At this point, the number of hours I have into the footwork to complete the claim makes the insurance unreasonable."
7386,BB,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 28 2025,Quick claim adjustment. Fast payout. Easy process.

7412,OW,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 27 2025,My recent claim was denied due to the fact that I didn‚Äôt spend money to see a doctor although I knew I was sick and incapable of travel. That is the reason that I purchased the trip insurance was to make sure that I would be covered in case I could not travel.

7447,TE,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 27 2025,"Decided on Allianz annual travel insurance rather than just insuring individual trips as we had been doing due to their remarkable reputation, great plan selections and very competitive rates. Before our planned start date, I began investigating a lengthy trip with our (full time college student) daughter and decided to reach out to Allianz to inquire about the possibility and price of adding her to our policy. I was impressed by the quality of communication, knowledge, concern and effort put forth to address this and even more astonished that they were able to add her completely free of charge to the policy. Having never made any sort of claim, nor even reached the policy start date, Allianz has won a customer for life as I‚Äôm fully confident they will be responsive and lend support in a time of crisis."

7453,NO,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 27 2025,"The ease of renewing an expired policy was quick and painless. Having the certificate of insurance was 'comforting' to have on hand, even though like most insurance, one hopes to never have to need it."

7472,DQ,3 ‚≠ê,Jan 27 2025,"Getting the Policy was easy.  However to truly understand what you were buying it was necessary to read a 45 page tiny print contract.  This is the loop hold insurance companies use to stall paying claims.  This document could be reduced to a few simple pages in clear language, but then people would know what they were getting and perhaps not buy.  After laboriously reading through I realized that the very reason I bought the policy would not be covered unless I got an additional premium."

7480,RT,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 27 2025,Because I chose to cancel a trip to Springfield MO from DC during forecasted snow and ice weather Allianz isn't going to refund my trip. Delta did eventually cancel the ATL to Springfield leg.  I purchased the insurance because it was winter travel.  Allianz says essentially you have to travel to get paid.  Never again.
7481,JR,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 27 2025,I‚Äôve been asked for documents multiple times even after they were submitted and still have not been given an update on my claim.

7487,JE,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 27 2025,"What a joke this insurance is. I will NEVER again purchase insurance to cover me like this. I called and spoke to a person on the phone concerning my trip and the reason we had to cancel. There was no help given and I have never heard back from anyone for weeks after I filed my claim. All the paperwork was uploaded and all necessary items filed. I was then informed that I can only receive up to $250 back from insurance. For a $1200 event I insured! This is a scam and I am so mad I fell for it. Shame on this company. If you are considering ""insuring"" your tickets, don't bother. They will never pay."

I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
7490,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective.

She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

7501,SM,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 27 2025,"With my recent claim, Allianz did very well. They were prompt and fair in making the decision. However, I had another claim in July 2023, when I was traveling to Germany. Once day before my return back to the US, my tooth broke and I didn't have time to find/treat my broken tooth while packing to return. Upon arrival at the IAD at around 4 pm, I called my dentist and made an appointment right from the airport to fix my tooth and I was given the appointment the next available date. I sent all the evidence and proof of my broken tooth and my doctor's confirmation, but Allianz still refused my claim of less than $250, which was very unfair. I wish Allianz uses a fair judgement and deal with such cases fairly."
7502,ME,4 ‚≠ê,Jan 27 2025,The process was really straight forward. I was able to easily submit the request and upload the pertinent documents.  Only issue i had was the limit of 250 characters for the explanation of the issue. It should be extended to at least 500 characters.

The supervisor, ‚ÄúJeff‚Äù was not empathetic to my needs. Told me not to call him buddy because it‚Äôs disrespectful. Was told claim denied due to not being a covered reason in contract.  However, I read the contract word for word and my reason IS covered.  Shoddy business practices. Not empathetic to the needs of the customer. They simply don‚Äôt care. I will not use this service anymore. Would give zero stars if I could.Update: I just received a cookie cutter response apologizing for their ‚Äúservice,‚Äù if you can call it that. Too bad when you call and speak to real people about real issues all you receive are directions which lead to nowhere. You finally give up when you realize you are just taking four right turns.

It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
7610,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"
7611,JY,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,We have purchased travel insurance with Allianz for every of our trips since Covid. The company has excellent customer service. Quick response to all our issues. It is a great peace of mind when we travel around the world knowing that Allianz will always be there to assist us.
7612,DA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,My husband had unexpected open heart surgery that caused us to cancel a trip to see family in December.  We were able to get credits for our air but needed to cancel a non-refundable condo in theCA wine country.  Allianz reimbursed the fees that were assessed.Then a month later he needed another procedure that caused us to cancel a cruise!  Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.
7613,KE,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 26 2025,Easy process with my claim. Can only recomend to use them. Payment quick and simple.
7614,DB,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 26 2025,"We were very disappointed we had to cancel our trip due to illness.   Once we recovered, Allianz's claim instructions were thorough and clear.  We submitted our documentation and received our payment without dispute and pretty quickly.We are rescheduling the trip and will be using Allianz for trip insurance.Thanks for the great service"
7615,MO,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 26 2025,My insurance claim was never even reviewed and therefore there was no point in buying the insurance.
7616,Susan,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 26 2025,"I LOVE writing positive reviews! First and foremost I have been an Allianz customer through the decades! What made it great was buying Allianz insurance in the first place and having it work for me when needed and they came through!After getting no where with American Airlines Claim Dept. from Oct. 2024 - January 2025, I called Allianz. I had to wait almost 3 weeks for a response, but it was a positive one! I was given a full monetary refund for two non-transferable AA airline tickets purchased to a location family wedding to be held at The Biltmore in Ashville, NC on Oct. 5, 2024. We all know what happened in that area because of Hurricane Helene.The Allianz customer service reps were patient and empathetic to my plight and explained everything I needed to submit for a claim, and it worked! I truly am very grateful and will continue to use Allianz in future travels. So thank you, Allianz!Sadly, American Airlines let us down terribly. We have been loyal customers for 21 years and we were at the beginning of the AA Mileage rewards program. We purchased 2 tickets to Ashville, NC on March 27, 2024 for an October 5, 2024 wedding. The cost was over $1,000. The Biltmore cancelled the wedding September 30th and the guests were then informed, and we cancelled our trip. The bride later rescheduled for April 6, 2025. The devastation and loss of lives in Ashville, NC from Hurricane Helene was horrific. American Airlines cancelled our flight on Oct. 4th. They would NOT extend our Flight Credit of even 9 DAYS before the 1 yr. purchase deadline of March 27, 2025, AND they would not refund our money with a Travel Credit! They did not care enough, and we are heartbroken by that.We had also purchased 6 tickets with American Airlines, with cash and points in March of 2024 for our 10-day family trip to CA and HI trip to be used in December 10-18, 2024. Obviously we were doing a lot of business with American Airlines. Why they didn't make the effort to accommodate us with a cash refund is beyond us. I'm glad this frustrated ordeal is behind me, and I hope someone in corporate American Airlines reads this review!"
7617,LM,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 26 2025,"Had no problem getting a refund, we were not able to attend because of illness. Very prompt in reimbursing us. Thank You"
7618,TO,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 26 2025,"Disappointing not having genuine support and understanding for what people have occur in their lives. We had a furnace go out and needed to use the funds to offset the cost of the materials and install and because it happened outside of the ‚Äúemergency‚Äù 12hr period we were denied our claim.Peace of mind is subject to other people‚Äôs policies and procedures, not real life situations.

7623,JM,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 26 2025,"I usually am skeptical about buying extra insurance for tickets but I decided to try it this time and I was pleasantly surprised that the experience went well.

7649,KS,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 26 2025,"Every time they ask for more information I provide it.  Yet somehow that process never ends and despite meeting each requirement they have so far not paid out on my claim.  A measley $1,000 to them is a LOT of money to me."
7650,CA,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 26 2025,Bad experience. I had a lost item and the company made it so difficult to submit a claim requiring documents that were unattainable for my situation. The customer service rep was very difficult to understand and the whole process was a waste of time and money for me.
7651,MM,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 26 2025,"My last flight from BOS to FLL was supposed to depart at 710am and with various delays due to reduced help and lastly due to mechanical problems we were forced to sit on the plane until it finally departed at 1215pm. We waited more than 5 hours. My children rented an expensive condo on the beach at Ft. Lauderdale and we missed the entire day, arriving for dinner.

I sent in new flight itinerary which reflects delay, but this is not enough.  Now i have to reach out to flight agency for a letter/document.  I'm not sure time and effort to obtain the documents is worth the money in the end.  Big disapointment.Addendum: i did ultimately receive reimbursement for my claim and appreciate the further review by Allianz of my original submitted documents.  I anticipate continued improvements toward making the time required in the claims process match the value of the insurance.  Thank you."
7655,JU,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 26 2025,Our claim was handled professionally and efficiently. It didn't take them long to process our claim and refund our money.
7656,JT,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 26 2025,You want so much information from both parties even though one party is a companion and would be covered by the problems with the other party and you want it sent by computer which we are older and don‚Äôt do very well. We would prefer a refund of our premium payment instead of trying to deal with your god-awful process.

Two weeks before the event, we got word my Mother-in-law was in the hospital and not doing well. We made a beeline to Texas, but after 8 days she decided she'd had enough and chose to enter Hospice. The concert was now completely out of the picture, so I submitted a claim for reimbursement from Allianz Partners USA. Within 48 hours the money had been transferred to my account.

My entire month's vacation there wound up having to be in bed almost all the time. I knew I wouldn't be able to sit for so many hours on our return trip. I contacted Allianz and they were so helpful and responsive to my needs. They recommended doctors in the area to see and upon documentation of my medical condition and release to travel by the doctor if I could be fully reclined, provided travel arrangements for myself and and my husband so he could assist me during flight. We were picked up in a van and transported to and from the airports and were given fully reclining seats during the long trip home to San Antonio. I've purchased travel insurance from Allianz every time we've traveled and this was the first time we actually had to use it and were so thankful for their kindness and consideration through the entire situation."

7747,Rich,4 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,"I like that it's easy to use the webpage as I am technologically challenged.

I'm beyond disgusted and frustrated with them."
7751,MF,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,"Allianz is excellent I was in a foreign country I got sick, I call Allianz number in USA, they sent me a Doctor to my  hotel where I was staying. Then I filed a claim for the trip interruption, they pay me no hassles. Graet Company!"
7752,RR,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,Allianz was very misleading and vague about what would be covered with our insurance plan. We had to pay out of pocket and they were unwilling to reimburse us for anything. Get your travel insurance elsewhere

Never heard a word from our airline for refunds after three weeks so went on the insurance app.  It was very easy to use and apply for a partial refund for the rental car we needed to get home and was surprised how very fast the process was.

On return from our London our flight was canceled for a day and also our one of the baggage was lost which was found later and delivered at our home. Also, our return airport was changed from Newark to JFK which caused us extra travel expense. The total compensation was given by this company was $600.00 which was our premium to get the insurance.  We didn't have enough patience to deal with C grade customer service."
7771,KC,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,"Very quick review and payout. But more importantly, the claim submission website was clear, complete, and easily understandable.

7772,DJ,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,Could not be more happier with the service provided by Allianz. The claim process was straightforward and I was updated as it progressed.

7788,Gary Dale,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,Filed a claim with Allianz in Nov 2024 due to an illness while on a cruise ship.  Submitted bill from cruise ship medical center.  Called Allianz after a few weeks of hearing nothing.  Was told to submit the bill again.  Called Allianz again after a few weeks of hearing nothing.  Was told they would get back to us in a week.  Called Allianz after not hearing from them as promised.  On that call we were then told additional paperwork from the cruise medical center was needed.  This was 2 months after submitting the first set paperwork and 2 calls with Allianz!  We travel extensively and guess who we will not be purchasing travel insurance from in the future.

7794,JE,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,Super fast response on my paid claim. Will buy insurance with you again!!! Thank you!!
7795,JL,4 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,"I always buy the protection plan for my events because you just never know. Allianz covers so many other reasons in the event something were to happen. We had an immediate death in the family and we could not make our trip. What I mostly appreciated about this recent claim was the turnaround time for payment and the approval. Reason for not giving it 5 stars. The beginning of the claim was not so great, given I had provided all the documents they wanted and more. The last document (death report) I submitted sounded like it wasn‚Äôt going to suffice and they wanted copy of death certificate which was going to take 4-7 wks. After reviewing, they went ahead and approved it. The customer service representatives were very slow and every call I made to them I was repeating the same story and information."

7806,DD,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,Submittal process was easy and while it said it would take approx 14days for the process to conclude it took less than a week from when I submitted.  My claims were both approved with no issue.
7807,UC,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,"I specified that my purchase of Allianz Insurance was for EVENT TICKETS.(1) Allianz did not inform me that there is a finite ‚Äúcap‚Äù on the dollar amount it would reimburse for filing a claim regarding ticketed Events. If I had known that I would not have used Allianz because that means my claim reimbursement - if approved - would have been less than half of what I actually paid for the tickets.(2) Allianz did not specify that only a few select, documentable reasons would be acceptable for claim filing, approval and reimbursement on Event Tickets.  I paid a very hefty fee to Allianz for absolutely nothing; they happily took my insurance fee without providing insurance."
7808,CU,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,"There was some misunderstanding by us of the website, but with the help of Allianz personnel and our travel agent it was cleared up expeditiously."

It's been a week and haven't heard back yet, but hoping I provided all the correct info and documentation. Hope to hear from you all soon."

7836,DI,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,They covered all new costs. Great.
7837,VM,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,"Allianz is a scam. Upsell insurance on airline tickets and then when you go to use it, they deny every single reason. I‚Äôm now reviewing the fine print with my lawyer to submit an appeal of what should be covered. Was in a major accident in a taxi and hospitalized and they denied my claim? Customer service dodges you, ghosts you, and they ask for documents repeatedly and disappear for months on end. I gave them a second chance and unfortunately they failed yet again. I will never buy another Allianz policy and will warn my social media followers to stay away. I‚Äôm also sending AA a letter about the repeated issues with Allianz and to rethink their partnership."
7838,AW,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,"I take multiple trips a year so being able to buy travel insurance to cover multiple trips allows me to concentrate on other logistics while traveling. My insurance was scheduled to expire while I was on a trip but Allianz text messaged me and asked if I wanted to renew my insurance for another year which I was able to do without difficulty, thereby extending my coverage."

7845,JV,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,I got insurance for the flight and insurance for the hotel. I had to cancel due to am injury. I gave them my documentation and was reimbursed fully without issues. The only issue I had is with Allegiant giving me credit instead of a refund. Very glad I got insurance.
7846,FY,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,We had a 3 hour flight delay from DFW to HNL causing us to miss our connecting flight to LIH. We couldn‚Äôt even find a hotel but rented a car because they close up the airport.We submitted our information and after a few days our request was approved and paid.

7848,ZX,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,"The insurance  is so high, but there are so many restrictions and challenges, and the reimbursement process is so cumbersome. I will not buy it next time. I would rather pay more for the airline's refundable ticket."
7849,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
7850,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

7862,RC,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,"Wonderful customer service. You investigated my claim in a timely manner, and kept in communication with me to keep me updated about my claim."
7863,HE,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,Nothing but a run around and hours on the phone. I speak with a person that tells me I need a certain document and when I up load it someone else tells me its not the correct document and I have to start all over again.Not happy!!
7864,CL,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,We are long term insureds. Renewing is easy.. I wish there was an incentive for those that renew every year as the price is always increasing.
7865,RJ,4 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,The process of submitting a travel delay claim was fairly painless.  I'd use the service again.

After sending the necessary paperwork I was reimbursed very quickly.
7870,GF,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,Easy professional and quick
7871,CU,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,I bought the trip cancellation insurance to prevent extra expense if my trip got canceled. My trip got canceled and rescheduled for a higher price. Had I kept the original date I would have incurred housing and transportation costs that were unnecessary since my job was delayed by 2 days. I will never buy trip insurance again! For that matter I am becoming anti insurance because y‚Äôall are just a money grabbing company that say you‚Äôll be there if needed then deny claims to be profitable.
7872,AJ,3 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,"I found the process of making a claim to be frustrating. It required someone to read the claim and make a decision within a set timeframe, which was often 14 days. I was in a situation where I needed my claim processed immediately to return home from another country, but your services were unhelpful due to the timeline. Anyone traveling during an emergency on a weekend would feel like they wasted their money, as claims are only reviewed from Monday to Friday."

7895,Meagan Hall,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,"We purchased the cancel anytime coverage for our cruise and ended up cancelling 5 months out. The cruise didn‚Äôt refund the deposit but Allianz did. I made a request and submitted screenshots of our cruise payments, which was very easy. About a 5 minute form. Then waited 11 days and got an approval letter without having to do any back and forth. Payment was in our account the same day. I would highly recommend purchasing their coverage on any travel plans you have."

7907,CM,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,Very good smooth process
7908,JC,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,I would give them zero stars if I could. I got this insurance in case something happened and we couldn‚Äôt make it to the concert. Well something did happen and the trip was cancelled. They won‚Äôt refund the tickets. You can only get a refund for certain circumstances. Even with proof of the cancelled trip and proof of the reasons why the trip was cancelled and why wont be able to make the concert they still denied the claim. The conditions for refunds should be available to review BEFORE you purchase the insurance. Not worth it and I‚Äôm stuck with tickets I can‚Äôt use or sell and I can‚Äôt get a refund. I will NEVER purchase ticket insurance through Allianz.

The whole process lacks a personal touch."

7967,LF,2 ‚≠ê,Jan 24 2025,"Our ordeal was as follows.Linda (Cherene) fell on the very first day of the cruise (Saturday, December 7), within about an hour of departure.She was in the ship's hospital for almost two days and we incurred medical bills.We were then transferred (Monday, December 9) to a Mexican hospital (Blue Net) where we incurred more medical bills.We had been informed by the ship's doctors who were in email communication with Alliance (you should be able to access these emails) that she was not going to be admitted to the Mexican hospital, but we were to be met at the Mexican hospital by an air ambulance service and transported back to the US to UC Irvine. All of it covered by Alliance.I spoke on the phone to a Dwayne at Alliance on Sunday night (December 8) who said he could see the emails and then confirmed the arrangements. You should also have some documentation of this conversation. The only open item was which hospital she was to go to. The Ship's doctors and Captain preferred Blue Net where they had a prior relationship with, and Alliance wanted her taken to a different hospital. Emails from the ship had requested this. Dwayne said he could see this email request as well. I too requested Dwayne to have her taken to Blue Net. Dwayne told me that this was possible and that a Case Manager would call me back immediately. A Case Manager never called back. The Ship's doctors told me later that night that Alliance had approved her going to Blue Med for transportation back to the US.These arrangement had all been confirmed.When we arrived at Blue Net, Linda was there, not admitted. I inquired about the air ambulance and I was told by the Blue Net administration that the air ambulance was confirmed and that they were waiting for the air ambulance staff to arrive. We did not know at what time. We waited, in the belief that the air ambulance staff would arrive almost immediately as arranged. It was critical that Linda be taken to UC Irvine in California as soon as possible for surgery.As time lapsed, I called Alliance. I was then told to my shock and dismay that no air ambulance would be coming. While I was trying to figure this out and speak to Alliance, there was NO cooperation from Alliance.This threw us into a tail spin and panic. At that time, my only concern was to get get Linda back to the U.S. urgently. I would settle the Alliance matter later.We were in constant communication with my children in California (my two sons are doctors) and my daughter who were very concerned and were trying every option to get her back.We tried to make private arrangements for a Mexican based air ambulance service through the hospital. My daughter was looking for the service in the U.S. Time lapsed. We then began making arrangements with the Mexican company at a cost of $35,000.After two days of stress, panic and aggravation with no cooperation from Alliance, we found that the Mexican service was not able to get her into a U.S. hospital, and on time. More time had now lapsed.We then made a collective decision to fly her home on the first available commercial flight, with a lot of pain and discomfort to Linda and stress and anxiety for both of us, which we did. She was taken to UC Irvine for surgery.It is my understanding that Alliance should have facilitated her transfer by air ambulance back home and to the U.S. I have read the entire policy provided to us and it is still my understanding. All arrangements were agreed upon by all parties.Why was this not done?What is Alliance going to do about this? This matter is not closed.Dayantha Manilal Fernando(Linda's husband who accompanied her on the cruise and was with her throughout the ordeal)UPDATE:While at the Mexican hospital - BlueNet - we were told that the hospital was in communication directly with Alliance and that Alliance had agreed to be billed directly. Bills were to be sent to Alliance. We were requested to pay a deposit of $6,300.Alliance now wants us to submit the bills to them and has not reimbursed us our money.Terrible service and experience.AAA, our travel agent was also involved in all of this."

It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple.

I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
7970,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy.

8000,JD,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 24 2025,"I purchased insurance for tickets to see A Beautiful Noise in Philadelphia in December.The tickets were a gift for my 82 year old mother.  The morning of the play she was suffering from flu-like symptoms and other forms of illness and determined she was not able to attend.  Nothing that we felt required a doctor visit, but certainly requiring her to stay in her home until she was better.I called Allianz to explain the circumstances and get a refunr and was directed to the website where, without a note from a physician, I was unable to proceed for a refund.If there is a way to proceed in gaining a refund on my tickets, I am open to and welcome a discussion / direction."

Seriously....This was all via email. Gave them Dr information, They could have contacted Dr to get whatever else they needed. Should not have to go through this when father is terminal. Called venue directly. Were very kind and refunded ticket price. Why get insurance if they aren't going to do some of the work, especially in a horrible situation.I understand providing Dr info.

8061,LB,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,I was looking for travel insurance to cover overseas medical costs in case of an emergency because Medicare doesn‚Äôt necessarily cover out of the country costs. I found an annual coverage contract for a very reasonable price.
8062,GC,3 ‚≠ê,Jan 24 2025,I didn't like that I couldn't get reimbursement for the credits given to me by the Airlines if I have no plans to go anywhere to use my credits.

8065,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
8066,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

8069,AL,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 24 2025,"It was a complete hassle to collect, photograph and upload claim stuff.  I submitted stuff last week and have heard nothing.  Likely we will never buy trip insurance again."

8078,JC,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 24 2025,I have been used this insurance many time I have a fly and by the end of the fly I felt very secured. Thanks o heaven to be Allianz part of my ventures.
8079,SP,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 24 2025,"Everything!  My mother is in the hospital fighting for her life and your bogus insurance doesn't cover it! When I purchased the airline tickets in November of 2023 for my Cruise set to leave end of July 2024, i was given an option to insure my flight without different policies to select from. It was one policy that I couldn't even read. I did not plan on my mother needing a liver transplant in March of 2024. Because of this event, I needed to cancel my cruise plans as the transplant has had many complications. Instead of canceling, I rebooked a cruise for end of April 2025 and asked the airline to change my date to April 25, which they did. I thought by doing this my policy would carry on with the tickets until they were used. My mother will likely not make it and for circumstances beyond my control, I can not attempt this trip in good conscious when I may be mourning the loss of a loved one. I gave you all the evidence you needed from the ICU (doctor's letters with hospital insignia on letter head, email receipts from American Airlines, and they're playing the ""policy doesn't cover that time period"" card. So I am stuck with a $3,370.40 credit with American Airlines that expires in April 2026. When i spoke with Allianz representative she just kept regurgitating the same old line that the policy doesn't carry over. Instead of putting a decision maker on the line, or attempting to work with me, the answer was no. I was not told by the airline when I rebooked that the policy ended, or that I should purchase a new one. I probably would have at that time not knowing my mother's future. I've heard from people never to purchase these because of the fine print. I learned a valuable lesson to never purchase the insurance again and save my money. I travel often with my family of four and when I don't have someone dying in my family, they're very successful trips. Allianz are a typical insurance agency!! The status quo."

8083,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,"I used Allianz to insure a recent trip to include a cruise. While on the cruise, I became quite ill and had to go to the ship‚Äôs hospital for treatment. Upon my return, I filed a claim for the cost, and was reimbursed within the next week. The filing process was so easy, and the follow-up communications via email and text allowed me to track the processing of my claim easily. I will definitely use Allianz for all of my future travel insurance needs."
8084,CA,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,Everything was resolved quickly.
8085,EC,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 24 2025,"Finally, the company resolved my claim, although not satisfactorily for me. After spending 12 hours at the airport, sleeping on the ground in a snowstorm, the company reimbursed me only for what I spent on a cooler, chips, water and coffee. But I expected them to respond for the bad night I had due to the negligence and lack of communication from the airline. Calculating what they reimbursed me, it doesn't even come close to what I pay for insurance. I understand that for claims for Trip Cancellation it covered $833.99 and for Travel Delay Coverage $300 and I only receive reimbursement for the chips. So I don't know why they have these benefits in these cases, when I sent all the documentation for the Cancellation and the delay in the flights for 12 hours. Something that was out of my hands and the airline does not provide options for me or for much that night. Only ""Have a good night"" and nothing else. For my next trip I will not put any insurance."

Maybe I didn't fully understand our coverage, but it says in the policy: Travel Delay Coverage---Maximum reimbursement PER 24-HOUR PERIOD of DELAY with receipts DAYLY Limit is $150. Our trip was delayed for 3 days. We received check for $300. Is that correct? Sincerely Alex."

8109,JE,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,Allianz makes filing a claim very easy.  They provide step by step guidance to make the process fool-proof and even give you access to see where you claim is in the process.  The cost of insuring the travel was nominal and I'm very glad that I did since holiday travel tends to be dicey.
8110,AF,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,Reporting and claims initiation were easy.
8111,TE,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,"One of our sons could not attend a concert with the family because of an unexpected childcare problem.  We could not find a byer for the ticket.

8122,SH,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,"Allianz has earned my trust and commitment to their organization!I fell ill a week before our cruise vacation and was not able to travel.  I was very concerned about canceling the trip and what I would need to do to process a claim or how many hoops I would need to jump through.  I did not know at the time how user-friendly Allianz‚Äôs website was and the ease of submitting a claim.I gathered and uploaded the required documentation and was blown away with the ease of the process and the speed of the claim.  Allianz has won me for life, and I have shared how impressed I am with this company with many friends, family and fellow travelers!If you are thinking about purchasing travel insurance Allianz is top notch and definitely stands behind their polices!Thank You!"

I got the insurance for a flight for my mom because i didn't know if she would be able to make the trip. She couldn't make the trip so i asked for a refund. It's handled like a regular insurance claim where they want all sorts of information including Dr. notes, death certificate, etc. And since i bought the ticket for my mom they sent the check(two weeks later) made out to my mom."
8126,A.,4 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,Easy.Filed and submitted documents online.
8127,LE,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,The insurance is well priced for an annual premium and the coverage is very good for the price. We feel more comfortable traveling when we know that we have coverage internationally.Renewing on line was simple and straightforward.

8130,MA,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,The agent was very knowledgeable and was able to guide me thru the questions I had regarding a claim - what was allowed and not allowed.
8131,MK,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,"We have been buying Insurance from Allianz for years without ever claiming any benefits. This one time when we actually needed to make a claim, our claim was denied. I purchased insurance, as always, it was offered at the same time as I bought JetBlue airfare tickets. On the way back, JetBlue delayed the departure time moving it to the next day. We had to rent a hotel, which was a little over $400 for the night. When I submitted that expanse for reimbursement to the Insurance, I was told that delays for less than 24 hours were not included in my coverage. I only had coverage for trip interruption and not for delay. Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt know the difference. In my opinion, my trip back home was interrupted by airplane delay. It just seemed that the Insurance Company has the power to word things in anyway they want to make sure you don‚Äôt get reimbursed. Not honest/ responsible business. Will never buy insurance from this carrier. There are plenty of companies that sell insurance and make you feel comfortable and protected. Really bad experience with Allianz."
8132,DR,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,Allianz reimbursed us promptly after an airline lost our luggage.
8133,RA,3 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,"I had a great experience with customer service representative when I called. I was told that we could be reimbursed for several things. When push came to shove after uploading all our documents and giving a statement of horrific travels, we received $300 for 2 people. I emailed back and was told contact a representative with my concerns. I asked for reconsideration and for documents to be reviewed again and received no response, but this ""Rate Us"" email."

After the documents were submitted the same day as aked it has now taken an additional week to get back to final review, This is a large reimbursement for a world cruise that had to be cancelled a week before due to a medical issue.Regarding your reply - I did that and it was another waste of time just rehashing the same thing without responding to the issue abd concern !!"

8181,JW,4 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,Pleasant experience.  Rated a 4 because we had to follow back up but understand that our trip had a high claim rate.  This is our trusted company for travel insurance
8182,JF,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,"Claim #: 0010385083:this case said completed 1/13 check $108.57 issued. but the Trip charge $780 was 'skipped' without any explanations. I called several times on this, your rep said I missed supporting doc said just submit those under the same claim#. I submitted 3 files at 1/15 per your instructions, also I made following calls C/S said you did receive it and all are ok.BUT, i have not received any updates so far.I am not satisfied of your services when I called Allianz # times.- the C/S did not tell me that you need more proof on the $780 charge when the case was in process, then 'complete' the case.- C/S told me to use the same claim# (which was 'completed') is it correct?- I login web see nothing was updated on this claim. usually, Allianz will keep me updated on the progress either on web or email, that was very good.!! when I call Allianz, the C/S should you 'clear or correct' response item by item, not just talk a lot that 'around' your questions.I told them that I prefer Allianz to send me email to confirm the key points so there should be no misunderstanding.I will wait and see how quick the Allianz to response of my concern with useful actions."
8183,AS,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,Very efficient handling of claim with excellent results
8184,JR,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,No one reached out to tell me why I couldn‚Äôt get a refund. The App is confusing. Asking for so many documents and no one reaches out. I will never purchase insurance from this company. I will make sure all of my family and friends don‚Äôt waste their money on this scam of a service.
8185,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.

I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
8186,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"
8187,JY,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,We have purchased travel insurance with Allianz for every of our trips since Covid. The company has excellent customer service. Quick response to all our issues.

8195,BT,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,The process of renewing my insurance was easy.
8196,Tami Danielle,4 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,"Four stars but very good travel protection. When purchasing any insurance one‚Äôs hope is the company honors its promise to pay valid claims, which Allianz did, and I thank them. Only giving four stars because the claim process is long (14 business days which equates to approximately three weeks), and the Claims app does not provide enough status details. The four options are: Claim Started, Being Reviewed, More Info Needed, Final Review, and Completed. Note the completed status fails to provide the amount approved and paid. Therefore I had to call Customer Service, which defeats the purpose of a self-help app. Otherwise, again, I am pleased Allianz honored its promise and paid my claim. I typically do not purchase travel protection because I‚Äôve always been skeptical and really had not considered travel interruptions, such as what happened in my case to occur. I just happened to purchase it for this trip and I‚Äôm glad I did. Thank you to Allianz."

8201,CM,2 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,Original claim should have been processed for the full amount. There was nothing out of the ordinary. Your request for additional letter documentation from the airline was simply a way of reducing your cost. trying to get a letter regarding the matter is impossible.
8202,BH,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,They worked with me and I received my refund in a very short time.

8216,PA,3 ‚≠ê,Jan 23 2025,We purchased the insurance to protect our purchase of soccer tickets. As it turns out my wife ended up being scheduled for surgery just days before the game so we unfortunately needed to cancel our plans. I called Allianz for instructions to cancel as we did not receive our policy through email. The cancellation was easy to do and we were refunded the money quickly with no questions asked. Why we didn't rate our experience 5 stars was due to the fact that Alianz uses call centers out of the country. There is no greater frustration then dealing with the language barrier from other countries when attempting to do business. Change your location to the USA to assist your customers and you get 5 stars.

A forecasted snowstorm the day of my arrival and into the next. I cancelled the room and when I contacted Allianz I was told because I was driving there and not flying, they couldn't refund the room. I would only be covered if a flight to my destination had been cancelled. Nowhere did I read any of this BS prior to buying the insurance because I would have definitely not wasted my money. So again like many insurers, they wiggle out of covering you for BS reasons DO NOT WASTE your money with this company"

The delay was more on our end, as the logistics of getting proper documentation was complicated by the fact that the providers who needed to respond were 300 miles away.  Some of the doctors and facilities that we needed to properly document the illness and eventual death of the sister were not very cooperative and did not furnish documentation in a timely manner.

8393,SH,3 ‚≠ê,Jan 22 2025,I liked what was going on when I first contacted the company. When I was ready to fly home Allianz dropped the ball. David made me feel like everything was being planned and worked out with my travel arrangements. After I got out of the hospital it seemed like the left hand had no idea what the right hand had told me. Allianz told me that it would take 2 or 3 days before a medical review board could like at my hospital discharge papers. This means that I would be paying for a hotel for at least 3 extra days out of my on pocket. I found a flight home myself instead of wasting my money on a hotel. I was sick and I needed to get home and not wait on Allanz medical team to make a decision.
8394,AM,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 22 2025,"The claim process is super invasive and a waste of time.  My mom had a brain aneurysm and they wanted me to send her medical records as proof?  No.  Very false advertising that it would be refunded or could change it.  My mother‚Äôs condition worsened so I wanted to stay longer but ended up having to come home because I could not afford another ticket.  Super waste of money and will never get it again.In response to yours:HIPAA applies to the patient and not disclosing medical information without their consent.  So when a patient is unable to give consent (induced coma) how am I supposed to get consent to give medical records to the company?  This really shouldn‚Äôt be marketed as flight insurance because all I wanted to do was change my flight.  I‚Äôm not trying to get anything out of it but love my flight to a later time.  That is what I thought I was buying.  Lesson learned though to really read into fine print because if it seems like companies are decent promising things, it‚Äôs usually a scam."

8425,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple.

She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

8443,PapPap,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 22 2025,"Allianz was GREAT to work with.  Unfortunateky, because of emergency surgeries at the time of our trip, we needed to cancel our trip.  We called right away and talked to a gentleman about our cancelation, and he advised us to go online , review the required documents, and file a claim online.  Once I received a letter from my surgeon, I completed the application process.  No additional information was requested, and we received a full refund in today's mail.Biggest recommendation:  Save ALL of your receipts and trip information, request a letter from your doctor if applying for a medical reason. When going online to file a complaint, read all of the instructions carefully, and make sure that you have all of the required paperwork.  The process was very quick and easy.  Thank you, Allianz!"

8503,PD,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 21 2025,"Dates of flight were changed and Allianz agent assured me that the insurance covered the changed dates.  The departure was canceled at last minute, so insurance interruption coverage was activated.  Claim for car rental was approved and paid.  Multiple emails for lodging seemed to disappear.  Hard copy was sent via regular mail to claims center with letter indicating that car rental was approved and approving the lodging would be a formality.  In spite of the acceptance of the rental claim, the lodging one was rejected, stating the coverage expired with the original dates of travel.  Could not get any explanation or resolution by speaking to an agent on the phone.  He simply repeated no coverage and refused to address the fact that the claim for the car rental had been approved for the changed dates.   For anyone changing dates of travel, don‚Äôt assume that Allianz insurance will cover the changed dates, because those agents at that company can‚Äôt agree on their own policy."

I was given a smaller return because of this.  I pointed out the error and nothing has been done.  I have called and emailed on numerous dates trying to get it corrected, with no assistance. The last time I spoke with someone from you company, they said I did not supply receipts, even though I have twice.  When they found the uber receipt that I submitted twice, they had no response and said they would look into it.  I have heard nothing back.  They said they mailed me a check.  I have not received it.   I will not use your company again.  Still waiting on the compensation that I am owed.Update to your reply:  I have contacted your company numerous times. Your response is you will get back to me and you have not. I provided you documentation that says the flight was canceled, not delayed. I have provided you documentation that the airline said they could not put me on another flight. You choose to only compensate me for a delayed flight, not a canceled one. I‚Äôve also provided you as stated earlier, a receipt of my Uber to get to my next destination which you did not reimburse.   If you would like to contact me, trust me you have all of my information to do so. It is been provided at least on four different dates.   I would like reimbursement for what I am owed.  Again, the error was on your part.  And you won‚Äôt rectify it."

8550,kyle brodnick,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 21 2025,"Absolutely the worst experience. I booked a non refundable rate with an Airbnb in New Orleans. Shortly afterwards, there was a terrorist attack, which killed dozens of people My girlfriend who lives in New Orleans immediately alerted me and said it wasn‚Äôt a good idea to go. I felt ok about it, since I bought the full Allianz package. They denied my claim, citing it wasn‚Äôt covered, even with safety being a number one priority. Now I‚Äôm completely out of $700. Where is consumer protection!? This is completely ridiculous. DO NOT USE ALLIANZ!!!"
8551,MJ,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 21 2025,Completely screwed me out of a refund. They made it seem like my trip would be covered and that was not at all true.

I caught her in a lie and I still can't get anyone else to help with my claims. I will never use Allianz for my insurance needs again! I recommend you consider other companies as well.

All that was left was one night at the airport hotel, less than I paid you for the coverage. I don't know how you could have been worse."

They paid about half what my expenses came to.  It was an exact round number (no cents, an even number of 10's).  Which makes me think I hit a cap on what they cover.  Would have appreciated being told that rather than just a check with no explanation.  Nonetheless I didn't dispute or question.  Thoughts of ""half a loaf"" in my head.

After a month, I received one very small payment.  I had to make several calls and contact my travel agent who interceded for me, before I received another larger payment.  No accounting was given for the amount I received.  I was told the policy did not cover the rest.  I disagreed and kept calling and escalating calls to supervisors.  After two more small payments, I tried to access my claim information online.  It said it was paid in full with no further information.  I continued to call, as I knew I was owed at least another $1,000, which I finally received in two more payments.   In total, I received six payments over a 10 week period, each requiring at least two or more calls.  At that point, I felt I had received approximately what I was due, although not entirely, and let it go.  No one ever called me to tell me why they weren't paying my full claim or ask for more information.  I've never had an insurance payment before that wasn't accompanied by an accounting of covered expenses.  I will never use Allianz again and I would never recommend them."

8666,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

8672,AP,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 20 2025,"I am extremely disappointed with my recent experience with Allianz Travel Insurance. I purchased their policy expecting peace of mind during my travels, but that was far from what I received.I submitted a claim after encountering a serious travel issue involving my travel documents, which disrupted my trip and incurred unexpected expenses. However, my claim was denied on the grounds that it was ""not covered."" What‚Äôs frustrating is that this issue wasn‚Äôt listed in the policy's exclusion section, so I reasonably assumed it would be covered, expecially since the error with my travel documents was not mine.The lack of transparency in their policy and the vague reasoning for denial left me feeling cheated. Customer service was unhelpful, and despite my repeated attempts to clarify why this wasn‚Äôt covered, I was met with generic responses that didn‚Äôt address my specific situation.Travel insurance is supposed to provide support in unforeseen circumstances, but Allianz failed to deliver on that promise. I will not be purchasing their insurance again and would caution others regarding purchasing their travel insurance."
8673,MI,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 20 2025,Decided to purchase the yearly plan for its price and outstanding reviews. Hope to never need but glad to know I put my trust in a reputable company

However, process to submit was a little over whelming because I could not find the reason as to why the people in my group could not make it. I would like to add that there should be more reasons available as to why someone could not make it to the event. I almost believed they wouldn‚Äôt give me a refund back. Make sure to have proper documentation! If it hadn‚Äôt been for my friend providing her doctors note I believe I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten the refund back. Speaking to an agent was very helpful!"

8724,JK,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 20 2025,I submitted a very detailed thorough packet with cross referencing to make the review much easier.  I believe this made Allianz's review much easier.  I received approval of my claim in a little more than 2 weeks with the check following in about another week.Thank you.

I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple.

I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
8786,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

Your staff tried to help but couldn‚Äôt other than directing me to do it myself. My is more about your system/process than your staff."
8800,EO,3 ‚≠ê,Jan 19 2025,"To file a claim on the provided phone number was impossible. Put on hold for almost one hour with reminders every two minutes that someone ""will be with you shortly"". Hung up and dialed again,  nothing  changed. Online claim filing was also a snag. It is understandable that losses must be reported in USD, even if your loss was abroad in rubles, rupees, pesos or Naira.No room is available to indicate the currency or its conversion rate to USD. Yet, receipts must be uploaded, no matter in what language or currency.The chat option to file a claim is a charade. The chat person or robot has no whif of patience but in a great hurry to terminate the chat.I have used Allianz several times for international travel and only this time when I have cause to file a claim  for 2 days luggage delay with miserable hardship abroad, Allianz proved truly that insurance is something you buy and Hope never need to use."
8801,JC,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 19 2025,It's nice to have the security of annual insurance for travel.

So it‚Äôs going to take even more weeks to get it. We‚Äôll see if I do."
8803,SY,4 ‚≠ê,Jan 19 2025,Fairly good experience but asks for too much documentation before paying out a claim.
8804,SJ,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 19 2025,Wow! I was pleasantly surprised with the response time and communication that was provided to me on my claim.  App features and website are easy to follow and understand.

Thank you as this was not something that we expected to take place in our lives but having the insurance proved to be very beneficial.
8805,Holly Cotton,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 19 2025,"I want to start by saying i will never by this insurance again!! Waste of money!! I bought the insurance in case something came up that we couldn't make it to the buffalo bills game we bought tickets to. We purchased the tickets in July 2024 and the game was December 2024. Our family dog (which is one of our kids, a family member!!) Got sick 2 days before the game we were in and out of the vet er with her everyday right up to the day of the game. Then the day of the game we had to put her to sleep... so of course we didn't go to the game way to upset and heart broken. I tried to file a claim to get our ticket money back and they tell me a ""dog"" isn't covered under the insurance!!! She is not just a dog she was part of our family!! It should be covered!! They were not willing to hear anything just kept saying that was not covered! So we will never use this again!!!"

So make sure if you have any kind of emergency that it happens MONTHS out. I was impacted by the fires in LA 2 weeks out from the event and they said they couldn‚Äôt expedite my claim and that the decision would be made AFTER my event, so the ‚Äúoptions‚Äù they gave me was 1:just cancel flights/room/rental car and hope it gets approved, and if not lose thousands of dollars on the tickets still or 2:go. Knowing that I was impacted by the fires. They recommended I just go anyways. Lack of any empathy. I was told different things by different representatives, given false hope and then being told by another that they cannot fulfill the promises the past representative had promised me. No reliability and process is extremely slow. Would not recommend unless you are 100% that an emergency will happen months out."

8958,DW,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,Sent in request for refund of two tickets with documentation. Never heard anything back from the company. Total rip-off.
8959,DG,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,"We had a medical situation arise and contacted Allianz representatives 3 times between December 22, 2024, and January 3, 2025.  Each time the representatives were very hard to understand, both accents and explanations to our questions. When we called the 2nd time to check on the status, we were told we needed to send additional documents.  We had never received notification of this by email, as stated on the website.  If we had not called, we would not have known we needed to send additional info.  After we sent additional information, we did get an email asking for yet more documents.  It was very confusing, and we had no idea how to get the documents Allianz requested. In the meantime, we contacted Hawaiian Airlines and went through their refund process.  Within 5 hours we had our refund."
8960,TM,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,I was unable to attend an event due to weather. The refund process was very fast. There was not a lot of red tape associated with the reporting or documentation.

8965,SB,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,They settled that claim very quickly and made a bad situation much better. I would certainly use them again thank you.
8966,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,"I have had an annual insurance with them for the last several years and while we have had no major claims every year, we‚Äôve had some sort of minor claim, whether it‚Äôs been canceling a tour because of sickness or luggage damage and every year we have had fast and easy payouts with no questions asked. I hopefully will never have to use it for a major issue, but if I do have to, then I do believe they will pay out in the same fast and easy manner that they have, which is why I will continue to buy annual insurance with them."
8967,AL,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,Quick response.

8972,GD,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,"Allianz recently processed a claim on an interrupted flight. The online process was very intuitive and easy to navigate -all clients need to do is have supporting documentation ready and follow the on-screen prompts. It didn't take more than ten days to hear back from them. While I was not reimbursed the amount I had in mind, I think it was generous and appropriate. Overall, they did a GREAT job; I will continue to insure trips with them and recommend them to other contacts."

I really would like this to resolve so I can try to make it up to my son. I thought purchasing the insurance was a good idea- thinking it might be a waste of money or a scam.Once it is resolved and paid asked me again and I may change my rating. Currently this has taken way to long and I am thinking this was a scam"

8983,PR,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 20 2025,"While was fortunate that I did not need to use my insurance during my 16-day stay (especially with the Midwest blizzard right in the middle of it), it was a comfort to have it availiable, and MUCH less expensive than that which the rental company was offering.  I learned that lesson the hard way some years back: ALWAYS go with an independent insurer when you rent a car."
8984,JM,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,Super easy and they paid my claim right away.

The first time I tried to use the insurance for a canceled trip, because of a covid illness, allianz would not payout because we did not see a doctor, it was a home test kit. So I was charged $2,900 deposit that was not covered!. That is not clear when you take out the insurance."

Within 3 days  had received our reimbursement from our show. The website is very easy to navigate, and the results were fast as well."
8996,MC,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,The company forces you to jump through hoops and give private information to rectify the issue.  It's not worth the hassle to continue to prove the reason for not attending a scheduled event. It's very time consuming and not consumer friendly. In the future I will never attempt to cover any tickets to an event with Allianz.
8997,LP,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,"We purchased a new truck and needed to cancel a policy working with Tammie was such a wonderful experience. Tammie made this dreaded task such an easy, quick response, and uncomplicated. Thank you."

8999,RH,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,"I have been waiting on an already approved refund for my insurance purchase for over a month in a half now. I have spoken with 4 different representatives who keep sending a check to the WRONG address, even though my correct address has been verified on every call. Also, the direct deposit to a debit card (that's offered) is a faulty option. I also cannot get a hold of a supervisor either and have been waiting for a 24hr call back twice now! All of this is absolutely frustrating being that I am a customer who always purchases insurance and this is the first time I've ever needed a claim for a refund. Ridiculous!"

9007,JB,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 28 2025,"I wrote a bad review on this website. Apparently, they didn't like it. So someone who works for them wrote me back saying that they're sorry for this inconvenience, ect, ect, and etc.  They also told me to write back to them to explain why I can't go to Wicked on April 22nd in Salt Lake City. I'm physically disabled and can't talk on the phone, unfortunately. I bought 4 tickets to Wicked through the ticket master for my mom's birthday, not realizing that I couldn't swap the tickets for ADA SEATING. I've done it before, although they were for sporting events and like a guy, I was NOT THINKING about it. So, I filled out a claim but they still denied me a refund of x amount. I appealed it with no luck. I don‚Äôt understand why buy it for them to deny it.."
9008,SB,2 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,Paid for concert ticket insurance. Winter storm arrived that night. Couldn't travel to the event. Filed a claim and haven't heard anything about a refund. What's the point of insurance.

It was clear what I needed to do to complete my end of the claim. I was updated through email, the app, and phone calls regarding the progress of the claim. This really gives me confidence that I also chose them to insure my trip in July of 2025. Definitely worth purchasing insurance on events and trips with Allianz!"
9012,HT,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,I provided the information requested and the claim was denied.  Not sure how you came to that conclusion.

9015,CP,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,"Personal communication would help with understanding process for seniors, because of our lack of computer skills. I feel discriminated against because I don't know how to perform the tasks needed. The texts that the airline sent about our delays, were sent to you. Due to technical problems with the plane we were afraid to continue with our plans. Fear was a big factor for our canceling.

It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
9026,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"

9031,CD,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,Allianz gave us the assurance that we were not alone. The pickup of my dad from the Caribbean was well-coordinated.
9032,JM,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,"I sent an email inquiry. Not receiving an email reply, I had to call and wait for 10+ minutes to reach a rep."
9033,BP,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,This company has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. It also has the most ridiculous policies in place. I filed my claim a month ago and still have no idea what is going on because NO ONE can tell me and apparently managers cannot talk to customers. I will never buy this insurance again and I will make sure everyone I know is aware of how terrible this company is
9034,WS,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,"I was on a trip to California and got food poisoning and was admitted to the hospital.   I was so thankful I had an Allianz policy as I had to file trip interruption and medical,  it was an easy process and my claim was accepted in a timely manner."

9036,BM,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,We had to cancel our trip due to weather. However that wasn‚Äôt an option to choose for the main reason. It did give me the option to choose the name of the actual storm that caused us to not be able to travel. But the claim was still denied because I didn‚Äôt choose an appropriate reason. So now I have to call to see if it can be fixed.
9037,TD,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,"Allianz global travel insurance is a reliable source. To me is very important to always apply for this travel insurance. I feel confident that if I encounter any mishaps regarding my flights, I can always contact Allianz global insurance. They have been very helpful.

We purchased 2 concert tickets that were well over $500 and our two travel partners the same.    Both of us purchased ticket insurance through Allianz from Ticketmaster.   Wow, that saved us.    We both got alll of our money back from Alllianz in only 4 days after we found out about the surgery and the doctor gave my wife a note.     Thanks Alloanz and Ticketmaster"

9044,RF,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,Because our flight was delayed 6 hours Allianz reimbursed us $150 for the trouble which was great. So many times you pay for insurance and it just disappoints but it actually paid to have it.
9045,BN,2 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,"I tried several times to speak to some one with my questions about travel insurance  but all I could get was somebody trying to sell me a life alert device, when I said that I needed a travel insurance, she said she couldn‚Äôt help me and hung up on me"
9046,JA,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,Would not buy insurance through this company again. It was virtually impossible to provide documentation that was sufficient to get a refund on tickets.  Waste of money.
9047,SM,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,My aunt died and I tried to file a claim. Said it doesn‚Äôt qualify. She is a step aunt married my uncle and she‚Äôs way younger than him so I always say she‚Äôs a cousin. She was shot point blank in the head on our way to the event. Horrible insurance!!!

9065,SH,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,"Filing my claim with Allianz shone a single bright spot into a horrible fiasco of a ruined holiday trip. I was so worn down from a nearly all-night delay in an airport where we were supposedly going to refuel after we couldn‚Äôt land in San Diego due to fog, but instead experienced cancelation after cancellation, that by the time I finally got home via a 3 hour Lyft to my home airport and another 2 hour drive home, I ended up very sick with the flu.The next morning I was alerted by email that my entire trip was cancelled. I was able to file my claim while sick in bed and the process was pretty self explanatory and straightforward. I was very pleased with the outcome. I was compensated for the delay and expenses. It was well worth the price of insurance. A tiny silver lining that I wouldn‚Äôt have had without insurance."
9066,LU,2 ‚≠ê,Jan 18 2025,"I can‚Äôt believe weAreStill dealing with this and that all we have provided isn‚Äôt clear enough. How can a diagnosis be more important than the fact that someone died. Also, the difference between what we paid and what they refunded us is the net loss with the agent. We have submitted all of that and the death certificate with the date as it coincides with the cancelled trip. WeCan‚Äôt talk to anyone and it keeps going on and on. Very frustrating!"

And we got our money quickly after fairly little paperwork.In short, we had been very stressed as we were dealing with a medical emergency just before our trip.

Even if they didn‚Äôt give me anything I would not receive a full refund for the plane tickets. Yes, something is better than nothing. But a non transferable  E-Ticket is nothing to me.

9139,CH,3 ‚≠ê,Jan 17 2025,"Am not satisfied with $73.36 payment only for receipts submitted. Allianz Policy states:Additional Payment Details:Baggage Delay benefit pays a minimum of $100.00 per insured for a baggage covered delay, without any receipts required for the purchased essential items, even if your claimed actual expenses for that period are lower.Expected $100.00 benefit payment¬†per insured. The $73.36 payment may satisfy one passenger reimbursement. We made minimum purchase for underwear and socks to get us through an over two day delay of getting full suitcase wardrobe. Experienced anxiety of not getting checked bags in time for Christmas following Sunday night 12/22 arrival. Bags finally arrived 7 PM Christmas Eve.An additional $100.00 payment is considered an appropriate compensation as baggage delay benefit for the other passenger.

Had a flight delay which necessitated an airline change to my itinerary; causing my checked bag to become re-directed and delayed 4 days to destination.

9158,KH,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 17 2025,"I am extremely disappointed with my experience with this company. I purchased a ticket with added insurance for extra protection, thinking I would be covered if anything went wrong. Unfortunately, I lost my home in the devastating Los Angeles County fires and was unable to attend the event. I thought this insurance would help me recover my costs, but it has been an incredibly frustrating and time-consuming process.The company has taken far too long to review my claim and has yet to properly compensate me. To make matters worse, they are asking me to complete a survey before they have even finalized my claim. It feels like they're prioritizing surveys and feedback over actually providing the service I paid for.I strongly urge others to avoid using this company. The lack of timely assistance, combined with the convoluted process, has left me feeling ripped off and completely dissatisfied. This experience has been a nightmare, and I would not recommend them to anyone."

This was our first time ever to have a trip actually interrupted by illness, and Allianz made the experience much more acceptable."

I have purchased Allianz travel insurance many times, but this was my first claim.  This past trip I was sick on the morning of my return flight, so I had to delay my return flight by two days.  Once home, I applied online using my receipt and travel itineraries for reimbursement under ""other,"" as Allianz's claims process did not have a category for delay due to illness, which seemed very odd.  The submission process was easy, including uploading my documents and providing bank information.   I received confirmation that my claim was received (12/19/2024) and would be reviewed.  In a few weeks they notified me that they approved $300 of my approximately $800 claim.  The money showed up in my bank account with no further action on my part.  I decided this was satisfactory.

9211,JG,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 17 2025,"I availed their services though I am not expecting to use it (of course who wants their flight to be delayed, cancelled or such in exchange of compensation? None as much as possible). My flight from Las Vegas to Los Angeles was delayed for almost 2 hours due to airline issue that resulted from my next flight to be missed as this flight departed already when I arrived. I ended up missing the flight and stayed overnight as the next possible available flight is the next day 09:00AM. This also caused me to missed my work as I am expected to be home already the night before. I can understand if this is my fault then that is fine. I filed for a claim. I even call before submitting the claim, in their website I am not sure which category this will fall in so I sent e-mail twice to their two separate e-mail address with no answer. I provided all the documents on my part (receipts, re-booking ticket and even testimony on my part) and submitted this under ""travel delay"" and ""travel interruption"" since there is no guidance and unsure where to put this under. And now, they just close my claim without any explanation. I called their hotline to ask why and the customer service even cannot give an assurance or clear explanation. Per him (customer service representative), he said that a testimony from the airline is needed. I called the airline but the airline is unsure about this as well. What the? I thought the insurance company will be the one to investigate/validate this as I never heard (so far) any instances that if a person missed his/her flight due to his/her not fault, the airline will give the person a proof that he/she missed the flight? I thought insurance agency will be the one to verify this. And yes, if this is my fault and a false claim, I can understand for Allianz to deny this claim. This is experience filled with agony in addition to stress and exhaustion. Do not waste your money to this. They will scam you."
9212,JG,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 17 2025,It was easy to file a claim with you. Your process was straight forward and were compassionate to my case. Thank you!

Unsure of the roads in the Dallas area and along I 20 we cancelled our reservation because of the forcasted winters mix and driving conditions. We were denied because snow and ice were not covered. The weather was completely out of our control and we felt it was too dangerous for and for anyone else on the road to drive.

9215,SW,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 17 2025,"I had a trip interruption and submitted a claim. It took 10 months to get a payment and the amount was incorrect.

My return trip was interrupted when Amtrak, on the day I was to depart for home, kept delaying my departure and then completely cancelled it.  I was forced to find a ride three hours away (I was in Northern NM where there is little to nothing in the way of rental cars, bus stations, air ports, etc.) just to be able to rent a car to drive myself home, a 10 hour drive. I submitted verification of all facets of this incident to Allianz, along with proof of costs, receipts, etc., and was told my claim was denied. I was given nothing.  My experience was that this insurance was pointless and a complete waste of money."

I called customer service yesterday and told me I missed two documents. My flight is next week, I simple do not know what I should do...."
9236,NI,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 17 2025,I‚Äôm still waiting on a refund. I was sick and couldn‚Äôt make the game over a month ago now. This insurance is crazy slow and horrible to communicate with!
9237,MD,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 17 2025,The people that I dealt with at Allianz were all very polite and knowledgeable and truly seemed interested in helping.The online claim system was overall very easy to use.

It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
9242,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"
9243,JY,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,We have purchased travel insurance with Allianz for every of our trips since Covid. The company has excellent customer service. Quick response to all our issues.

Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.
9245,TR,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 25 2025,Update: Shocker...my claim was denied because my family member died PRIOR to the event. Memorial was scheduled same day as event so had to cancel but even though option to upload proof of date of memorial was still denied. Biggest scam insurance I have ever used. NEVER will buy again.Was very difficult process to file a claim and bought insurance under false pretenses. Got insurance for an event and was a nightmare to get refunded which is not even approved yet over a week submitting it. Will never get this insurance ever again.

I looked at reviews afterwords and saw no good things about the company. Grateful for the refund , but will not use again."
9248,KV,2 ‚≠ê,Jan 17 2025,"I recently called your customer service line to clarify details about your annual plan, specifically regarding the 45-day policy. Unfortunately, the representative I spoke with was rude during the conversation. As a customer, if we already knew the answer, we wouldn‚Äôt need to ask for clarification, right?"
9249,KB,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 17 2025,My claim was reviewed and my money was reimbursed the same day I submitted my claim. Thank you for the quick service!
9250,JI,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 17 2025,"I had to cancel my flight due to medical reasons. I thought it would be a hassle to get the claim approved but I just submitted the paid invoice, cancellation notice, and Dr. statement and got the claim paid that day."

I had a lot of questions that were important for me to get answered before I chose which company to buy the insurance from. No other travel insurance company would even answer their phone, let alone give me answers.i called Allianz - on a SATURDAY!  - and a wonderfully friendly woman answered my call and ALL my many questions. I wish I had gotten her name, because she was so patient and helpful and took all the time I needed.

9293,DO,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,They made me jump through hoops for a concert ticket refund. Not accepting a surgery appointment. I had to get papers filled out and signed by the surgeon. Then the refund was issued in minutes. I'm sure it was not reviewed by a panel. I have cancelled expensive trips without all this paperwork.. I will not use Allianz again
9294,BM,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,"Incredibly disappointed with how my claim was handled. We provided proof of schedule change in custody issue that caused half the party to not be able to attend the event. Our claim was declined due to distance from the event not being far enough. Paid extra for insurance and it was useless, ended up losing hundreds of dollars on tickets that would not be refunded. Found out our claim was declined too close to the event to be able to sell them either."
9295,SM,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,Purchased the annual coverage. Very reliable and pays promptly. Keep your receipts!

Finally got Stephanie 1/15/2024  (excellent) on the phone and she knew to create a new claim number. Bravo! Today 1/16/2024 finally go Carlos Maritnez (excellent) on the phone and he was wonderful to get the documentation I sent  in December attached to the new claim number.Looks like you have some very good claims specialists and some that really do not know the process.

The airlines were very reluctant to even give me a partial credit (even though the national weather service was issuing warnings to night fly/drive) so when I filed the claim with Alliance to get the remaining balance refunded, the process was easy and the response was quick.  I was SO SURPRISED & grateful to get a refund."
9307,MS,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,"Very available, easy to apply for coverage, affordable. Fortunately, I have never needed to file a claim so I can't comment on that part of your service."

9351,WI,4 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,N/A
9352,NW,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,Very happy with the results!
9353,NE,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,"Very easy to work with and gave me clear instructions on what was needed to file the claim when I called the day we had our medical issue. Once I filed the claim it was easy to get the updates as the claim moved forward, and the check was received before we had to make the payment on our credit card."
9354,LM,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,Easy to understand what you are buying. User friendly website
9355,PB,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,"Exceptional service. We submitted our claim and within 2 days, the money was in our accounts."
9356,GP,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,"It has taken me 4 months to finally receive all payments for medical issues and trip interruption while my husband and I were traveling in September 2024. I still have not received all of the reimbursement I believe I was entitled to. The people I talked to were kind, but not competent. I was told different things each time I called. I will never use this company again."
9357,EB,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,My claim was settled quickly and I am so happy I used Allianz. I am very pleased.
9358,CS,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,Ease of use of the transaction.  Renewed plan quickly.
9359,JS,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,Fast and easy process. Great experience!
9360,CW,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 17 2025,"Please do not waste your money. This is a scam. Don‚Äôt let them fool you into a false sense of security, they will then lie to avoid giving you a refund or approving your claim."
9361,DS,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"I incurred a ""burn"" on my leg from a motorcycle accident while visiting friends in Australia.  It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
9362,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"
9363,JY,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,We have purchased travel insurance with Allianz for every of our trips since Covid. The company has excellent customer service. Quick response to all our issues. It is a great peace of mind when we travel around the world knowing that Allianz will always be there to assist us.
9364,DA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,My husband had unexpected open heart surgery that caused us to cancel a trip to see family in December.  We were able to get credits for our air but needed to cancel a non-refundable condo in theCA wine country.  Allianz reimbursed the fees that were assessed.Then a month later he needed another procedure that caused us to cancel a cruise!  Once again Allianz reimbursed the cancelation fees.We are sold on the Alliance annual plan and have already renewed it for this next year.
9365,Shirley Speidell,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,"Excellent support, clear instructions, transparent process, and quick response time.In addition, access to doctor appointments within an hour while traveling abroad was a life-saver!"
9366,JB,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,Just great follow through and openness to listen to the facts
9367,AJ,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,"Refusal to honor terms of my claim for trip cancellation due to Covid. I submitted all pertinent information, including the actual positive test. Now, nearly 2 weeks later, they requested a Dr's note. I took a Covid hometest, which was positive. Then, I isolated, per CDC recommendations.I incurred expenses to change my airline ticket, for which they refuse to reimburse.I do not recommend this service. Furthermore, the customer service agent was rude."
9368,TR,4 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,"On our last cruise, we saw injured/sick passengers departing the ship in foreign countries by ambulance. We decided then and there to look into full travel insurance.We bought an annual policy after reviewing our options online. The Allianz Website was reasonably simple to compare various coverages. The annual policy was fairly priced and a good value as we have multiple trips planned. The peace of mind is worth the price of our coverage."
9369,M,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,"While travelling I became ill and Air Doctor was an amazing, fast and great quality service. I highly recommend this company and Allianz. The doctor who I saw came to my house on the same day of the request and told me most insurance companies will not pay for the services I received, but she knew Allianz does."
9370,BK,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,10 days ago you congratulated me and said the account was paid with a check.  I haven't seen it??
9371,CA,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,The process was easy and my refund was extremely fast!
9372,MQ,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,Customer service is horrible. Representative seem to have very little understanding of his job. His articulation was horrible.  The turn around time for reimbursement is unacceptable.
9373,SH,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,I was shocked at how easy Allianz turned a bad airline experience into a positive one with the quick claim approval. I literally hard fund in my account within 48hrs.

9378,ML,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 17 2025,"This has been the worse experience of a customer care provider I have ever experienced. I was told my case worker would call me on Monday January 13th it‚Äôs now the 16th and I have yet to hear from the claim provider. Likewise, my case has not received the proper or appropriate attention it requires. The customer service is horrible"
9379,SM,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,Don‚Äôt waste your money with this company look into a different travel insurance
9380,MB,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,Easy website and explained process quickly.
9381,NO,2 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,"It has been 4 weeks and have not received approval of my claim yet.  Still waiting.  I have submitted documents online and uploaded additional documents SEVERAL times, and still Allianz ask for documents that I have already submitted.  Its frustrating.  I‚Äôve already emailed customer service.  It feels like I am dealing with an AI / robot instead of a person."
9382,MA,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,"Always read the details, that's where it's all about."
9383,ST,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,"I submitted my claim and the documents, then never heard back from Allianz. I won't be using Allianz again."
9384,JA,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,"I had an unexpected health event (stroke) that made it impossible for me to make a recent trip. Allianz was quick to refund the full amount of my ticket once I documented my medical situation. I will recommend that everyone get flight insurance for every trip because unexpected situations can and do occur! Thank you, Allianz!"

The website was user friendly and all together this made us feel relieved that it was completed so quickly so we can focus on our loved one who received devastating medical news.

9394,AM,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,I filed claim within 3 days of my trip completion and it‚Äôs now been a month and the claim has still not been processed.  Good thing it was not an emergency.  Probably would not purchase again as just not worth all the documentation and follow up.  Very frustrating.
9395,AD,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,Good access in the filing claim process

9398,YL,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,Got my claim resolved quickly very responsive!
9399,PW,2 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,Took to long to be reimbursed. You should tell people what you need UPFRONT! And not drag out the process the way you did. There needs to be a customer service number to talk to a real person. So impersonal. Come on people do better!!
9400,LH,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,Simple process and quick results!
9401,CL,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,"Waiting for a response , not sure why I would get a notice asking how it went when I have a case opened"

9415,SU,2 ‚≠ê,Jan 30 2025,"While their customer service people are polite and helpful, I was asked to upload the same documents multiple times. I had to show them my credit card statements to prove I actually paid for services I was seeking reimbursement on and only then did they reimburse me less than half of what I should have received since the delay was over 24 hours. Way too many hoops to jump through and I had to stay super vigilant. Frustrating. I‚Äôm still waiting on their review again for the other half of what should have been reimbursed.UPDATE: I did receive the balance shortly after writing this review."
9416,JW,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,Received the credit of the airfare very quickly
9417,MG,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,"Allianz alerted me to a possible claim. I filed the claim online in about 10 minutes, most of that was copying documents. Allianz processed my claim and made a direct deposit into my account."

9428,MI,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,"They quoted me $686, then, after I accepted terms and put in my credit card info, they charged me $781.When I called they were polite and tried to help, but could not; they suggested going online. I went online and the answers were not any better. It was obvious nobody actually read my complaint. I just got a stock answer saying I should call the helpline! I am at a loss."

9442,JP,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,"Broad coverage, even pandemic, for a VERY reasonable price.  We‚Äôve had just two claims in our 4-year history of AllTrip Premier, that covered the total cost of clothing during a 72-hour baggage delay & a damaged suitcase.  But it‚Äôs great to know you‚Äôre covered even when you DON‚Äôt need it!!"
9443,CB,3 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,This review is premature because this is the first time that I‚Äôll be using this insurance company.

9447,AR,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,"Purchased tickets for Christmas for my Fianc√© to attend Disney On Ice.After completing the purchase I immediately realized I selected the wrong venue which was clear across the country. I told the ticket company within 10 minutes after purchasing, they told me I had to go through Alliance since I had taken out the insurance. I was told to fill out a claim which I did right away. After several weeks my claim was denied because it didn‚Äôt fall into one of the categories offered. I am still pursuing this issue , I had to order another set of tickets and they would simply not allow me to exchange or offered any type of reimbursement.Lesson learned with both companies."
9448,JC,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,Seamless and easy claims process. I appreciate that the team called to check on my daughter the day after her hospital visit. Highly recommend!
9449,BS,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,I received a itemized bill from the guest medical company that they used to provide IV / antibiotics for food poisoning in Quito.  It was in Spanish and in someone else's name.  i don't read Spanish and had no idea.  With my credit card statement showing the hospital charge and my airline travel changes they honored the hospital fees and refunded me right away.  great service!
9450,BB,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,Put the proper information on your app.  The telephone number you have on the app goes to a crane operating company.  The company receives so many calls (hundreds per month). That they have your correct telephone number. The company said they have told you guys about this issues several times dating back several months and you still haven‚Äôt fixed it.  The person answering my call when I got through showed lack of interest in my problem and I could barely understand her.
9451,MN,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,"Initially we were really satisfied with our experience, as we experienced a flight delay on November 4th, and the system automatically initiated a claim for us without providing any documentation.  However, when we experienced a missed flight on November 30th, due to a late arriving connection, we were not able to get this issue resolved satisfactorily.  We made 5 different phone calls and spoke to 5 different representatives and supplied 7 documents supporting our loss.  Also, each representative indicated that we would have resolution within 3 to 5 business days, and we never received any feedback with regards to the decision.  In one instance, the representative scheduled a phone call appointment with a manager for the following week, and we received no phone call.The problem with your system is that there is only one claim per policy, when there are multiple issues with a given policy, there is no way to distinguish the date.  There needs to be the ability to open multiple claims against only policy, which help facilitate discussions on dates when problems occurred.  When you have a trip that is more than a month long with multiple flights, there is a chance there will be more than one issue."
9452,KB,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 16 2025,I appreciate how easy the claim application was to fill out and how fast the refund came through.

9464,MM,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,My flight was delayed I had prepaid Lyft so canceled Lyft because Delta said flight was missed made flight had to rebook Lyft out of pocket.  I never received the money caused by flight delay
9465,Paul Violand,2 ‚≠ê,Jan 17 2025,I filed a claim.  Have not heard back.OK..I received a response that they have the claim and are in the final review.
9466,KT,4 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,Renewal was easy. Thankfully haven't had to use the policy as yet so no comments on that.
9467,Moe Farley,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,THE PROCESS WAS JUST PLAIN EASY AND NOW I HAVE THE COMFORT OF KNOWING I HAVE INSURANCE PROTECTION IN CASE OF A PROBLEM ON ANY TRIP IN 2025
9468,PA,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,"This was my second experience with submitting a claim for airline tickets for a trip that had to be cancelled due to medical reasons and both times Allianz made the process fast and simple. After uploading documentation from my doctor, I was approved within 24 hours and received a refund check in a week. I always purchase travel and flight insurance with Allianz for trips and have not been disappointed yet."
9469,RA,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,"No hassle. Still waiting on the check, though."
9470,VM,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,quick and very helpful
9471,CU,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,"Decided upon advice to her before traveling, but not much time - easy app, easy process, signed up in just a few minutes!"
9472,DR,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,My policy renewal was super easy.
9473,SS,4 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,Terrific response to my claim re.delayed return!!! The reaon I gave a 4 was because I wish my hospital stay had been included in the policy.
9474,JR,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,"My claim amount was $230 but I had no receipts. Allianz paid $150, which I was very happy with."
9475,TB,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,so easy to use. Great value as well this was my first experience purchasing travel insurance it went so well
9476,CU,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,"I missed a concert because my father passed away in another state a week before the concert date.  Obviously getting reimbursed for concert tickets was not top of mind, and I did not even remember I had purchased the insurance until over a month post-concert. I was expecting Allianz to tell me that unless he had died on the actual day of the concert it wouldn't be covered, or that I had filed too late. In fact, my claim was approved the same day I filed it, and I got a full refund for the tickets plus a nice note of condolence from Allianz.Small caveat that, when I was filing the claim, it was jarring to see Allianz request a death certificate. When you look at the drop-down menu for accepted documentation, though, a pdf of the obituary was accepted, and that's what I used.Overall, I was really surprised by and appreciative of how quick and easy Allianz made the process."
9477,PR,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,got my refund within days. Very fast service

It required an emergency room visit and some followup which cost over $1,000 (AUS).  I paid the full costwhile in Australia and filed a claim the day after I returned to the States. I included full documentation with some some photos of the nasty injury. Allianz made this claim process simple. Within two days I was advised my claim was fully approved and a day later my full claim was paid to my bank account! These guys are great! I will not travel abroad without some level of additional medical coverage."
9482,NR,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,"The policy was very easy to buy. I was planning on 3 international trips in one year, so the young man suggested that I purchase the 1-year plan, being much more cost effective. Unfortunately, I had to go to the emergency room in Switzerland. I did need to pay the bill, then be reimbursed, but it was very easy and surprisingly fast! My friend in Australia travels frequently. She pays a much higher premium for her travel insurance. I am very pleased with your company!"
9483,JY,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,We have purchased travel insurance with Allianz for every of our trips since Covid. The company has excellent customer service. Quick response to all our issues.

9484,DA,5 ‚≠ê,Mar 18 2025,My husband had unexpected open heart surgery that caused us to cancel a trip to see family in December.  We were able to get credits for our air but needed to cancel a non-refundable condo in theCA wine country.

9488,TF,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,"I filed a claim and have not heard about it despite the fact that it is past the time I was supposed to hear. When I spoke with customer service representative, she said there was a new system and she had no idea how to get in touch with the claims department. I'm not sure if this is a legitimate business. I will be filing a report with the BBB."
9489,JG,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,The service was straight-forward and the process was easy. Allianz provided all the required features to provide what was needed. No hassle. Great service! I will continue to use their services.

9511,SR,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,"If I could give 0 stars I would. Horrible service they don‚Äôt want to help you for nothing, scammers like all the insurance companies. They didn‚Äôt help me get a refund for concert tickets even though I paid for the insurance. I called multiple times and they couldn‚Äôt help me so they scammed me with a lot of money. Would not recommend."
9512,SR,2 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,"I called when our flight was cancelled and I assumed they would be able to tell me what to do, but all they said was go to American Airlines center at airlines and see what they say.  There is nothing we can do now.  Hang onto all receipts and start a claim."
9513,GN,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,"Allianz has proven itself to us twice now with reliably and quickly managing claims and our policies.  In 2021, Allianz offered a refund of premium for a policy covering a 2020 trip cancelled for COVID.  Allianz offered that refund unsolicited by us, and to our pleasant surprise - we had expected the premium and claims lost for COVID as with the trip provider's cancellation.Allianz' processing of our recent claim due to the death of my wife's mother was prompt and covered all we expected and more.We sincerely feel Allianz is the best in the industry and is 100% committed to treating its customers with fairness, dignity, and promptness. We will continue to trust Allianz with our travel insurance needs."
9514,WE,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,Fast and efficient! I truly appreciate!

9516,AN,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,"While traveling abroad, I always reach out to Allianz, they are the best ones out there, and I always feel such a sense of re-assurance knowing I have coverage.  With  illness, accident, luggage being stolen, cancellations and Covid, just knowing Allianz has my back allows me to travel with ease!"
9517,RV,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,Quick turn around on my claim!
9518,PS,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,"Good pricing. Good experience in the past with a claim and also customer support questions and issues. Prompt and friendly service. Insurance is something you hope you never need to use, but the peace of mind of having a company at your back that has shown they are there if needed is great."
9519,RA,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,"You pay for the services, but you still have to call amtrack and cancel the ticket yourself, then you have to file the case with Allianz. They definitely are not helpful. If I have to do all these things, what do you guys do in the office. Look at the applications and approve them?Also thanks for sending this rating survey. I will now go on google and submit the same survey."
9520,RG,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,Claim Status - Communication with Allianz via the web portal is lacking at best. There is no clarity with regards to status or their requirements for additional information. It's a ping pong exercise.They do not return phone calls. They do not respond to emails (11 business day interval).Very frustrating and based on the current experience have no reason to select Allianz for travel insurance again.The single star ranking is generous.
9521,KE,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,Was able to get paid back for a missed cruise cause of a medical emergency.

This took some time and involved a number of phone calls and visits to the doctor‚Äôs office & clinic.Once we had the paperwork together the process was straightforward.We received a check for our losses promptly.I‚Äôll use Allianz if/when we travel again."
9525,HC,5 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,"Very easy and quick to get a claim paid. I lost my jacket during my trip and wasn't sure I was going to get that covered, and they did just with the replacement receipt. Did not give an grief."
9526,RC,1 ‚≠ê,Jan 15 2025,I sent in a claim and I was asked to send invoices for hotel and airfare but I used my points.  I sent numerous emails stating this and asked what I could supply instead of invoices.  I kept getting emails for the invoices but I don't have invoices because I used points for my hotel room and airfare!!!  I have hospital invoices.  Would that work?
